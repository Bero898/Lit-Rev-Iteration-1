abstract = {Cloud service providers often provision excessive resources to meet the desired Service Level Objectives (SLOs), by setting lower CPU utilization targets. This can result in a waste of resources and a noticeable increase in power consumption in large-scale cloud deployments. To address this issue, this paper presents DeepScaling, an innovative solution for minimizing resource cost while ensuring SLO requirements are met in a dynamic, large-scale production microservice-based system. We propose DeepScaling, which introduces three innovative components to adaptively refine the target CPU utilization of servers in the data center, and we maintain it at a stable value to meet SLO constraints while using minimum amount of system resources. First, DeepScaling forecasts workloads for each service using a Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network. Secondly, it estimates CPU utilization with a Deep Neural Network, considering factors such as periodic tasks and traffic. Finally, it uses a modified Deep Q-Network (DQN) to generate an autoscaling policy that controls service resources to maximize service stability while meeting SLOs. Evaluation of DeepScaling in Ant Group’s large-scale cloud environment shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches in terms of maintaining stable performance and resource savings. The deployment of DeepScaling in the real-world environment of 1900+ microservices saves the provisioning of over 100,000 CPU cores per day, on average.},

abstract = {Microservices architecture improves software scalability, resilience, and agility but also poses significant challenges to system reliability due to their complexity and dynamic nature. Identifying and resolving anomalies promptly is crucial because they can quickly propagate to other microservices and cause severe damage to the system. Existing root-cause metric localization approaches rely on metrics or metrics-anomalies correlations but overlook other monitoring data sources (e.g., traces). We are the first to identify and leverage the anomaly-aware monotonic correlation between heterogeneous monitoring data, motivated by which we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous data sources in Microservice systems for Root Cause Analysis (HeMiRCA), for hierarchical root cause analysis using Spearman correlation. HeMiRCA is based on the key observation that the microservice responsible for a particular type of fault exhibits a monotonic correlation between the trends of its associated metrics and the trace-based anomaly score of the system. HeMiRCA first calculates time-series anomaly scores using traces and then exploits the correlations between multivariate metrics and the scores to rank the suspicious metrics and microservices. HeMiRCA has been evaluated on two datasets collected from widely used microservice systems. The results show that HeMiRCA outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in identifying root causes at both service level and metric level, achieving a top-1 hit ratio of 82.7\% and 74\% on average, respectively.},

abstract = {This paper presents ScalarDB, a universal transaction manager that achieves distributed transactions across multiple disparate databases. ScalarDB provides a database-agnostic transaction manager on top of its database abstraction; thus, it achieves transactions spanning various databases without depending on the transactional capability of underlying databases. ScalarDB is based on several research works and extended to provide a strong correctness guarantee (i.e., strict serializability), further performance optimizations, and several critical mechanisms for productization. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ScalarDB. We also present evaluation results showing that ScalarDB achieves database-spanning transactions with reasonable performance and near-linear scalability without sacrificing correctness. Finally, we share some case studies and lessons learned while building and running ScalarDB.},
