In Power to the Public, Tara Dawson McGuinness and Hana Schank describe a revolutionary new approach—public interest technology—that has the potential to transform the way governments and nonprofits around the world solve problems. Through inspiring stories about successful projects ranging from a texting service for teenagers in crisis to a streamlined foster care system, the authors show how public interest technology can make the delivery of services to the public more effective and efficient.At its heart, public interest technology means putting users at the center of the policymaking process, using data and metrics in a smart way, and running small experiments and pilot programs before scaling up. And while this approach may well involve the innovative use of digital technology, technology alone is no panacea—and some of the best solutions may even be decidedly low-tech.Clear-eyed yet profoundly optimistic, Power to the Public presents a powerful blueprint for how government and nonprofits can help solve society’s most serious problems.","","9780691216638","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9519680.pdf&bkn=9519679&pdfType=book","Technology;Public interest;Public sector;Civil service;The Public Interest;Private sector;Nonprofit organization;Employment;Welfare;Organization;Code for America;Requirement;Public policy;Customer;Problem solving;Startup company;User experience;Call centre;Crisis Text Line;Project;Career;Princeton University Press;Homelessness;Processing (programming language);Government agency;Todd Park;Caseworker (social work);Designer;Government Digital Service;Design thinking;Policy;Copyright;Funding;Implementation;HealthCare.gov;Writing;Real-time data;Payment;Unemployment;Americans;Institution;Tax;Government Technology;Product manager;Accountability;Legislation;Business process;Consultant;Mikey Dickerson;Workforce;Unemployment benefits;Payroll;Voucher;Vendor;Recruitment;Economic security;Collaboration;Supervisor;Salary;Finding;Works Progress Administration;E-government;Website;Root cause;Incentive;Chief information officer;Design director;Think tank;Deloitte;Program management;Analytics;Politician;Lobbying;Publishing;Federal agency (Germany);Economist;Chief technology officer;Customer experience;Beneficiary;Recipe;Philanthropy;Data science;Technology company;Economy;Buy-In;Financial crisis;Georgetown University;Government Office;Determination;Public administration;Iteration;Minimum viable product;DJ Patil;Small business;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;Guideline;Civil society;Economics;Usability;W.

The larger the organization or the greater the amount of data being processed or both, the greater the complexity of the technology ecosystem supporting the data science activities. In most cases, this ecosystem contains tools and components from a number of different software suppliers, processing data in many different formats. There is a spectrum of approaches from which an organization can select when developing its own data science ecosystem. At one end of the spectrum, the organization may decide to invest in a commercial integrated tool set. At the other end, it might build up a bespoke ecosystem by integrating a set of open-source tools and languages. In between these two extremes, some software suppliers provide solutions that consist of a mixture of commercial products and open-source products. However, although the particular mix of tools will vary from one organization to the next, there is a commonality in terms of the components that are present in most data science architectures.","","9780262347020","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8544171.pdf&bkn=8544144&pdfType=chapter","","Data science;Organizations;Ecosystems;Computer architecture;Databases;Data warehouses;Tools","","","","","","13 Dec 2018","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

"3 IoT Data Processing: The Different Archetypes and Their Security and Privacy Assessment","",,"Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications","","2018","","","37","54","Internet of Things (IoT) security deals with safeguarding the devices and communications of IoT systems, by implementing protective measures and avoiding procedures which can lead to intrusions and attacks. However, security was never the prime focus during the development of the IoT, hence vendors have sold IoT solutions without thorough preventive measures. The idea of incorporating networking appliances in IoT systems is relatively new, and hence IoT security has not always been considered in the product design. To improve security, an IoT device that needs to be directly accessible over the Internet should be segmented into its own network, and have general network access restricted. The network segment should be monitored to identify potential anomalous traffic, and action should be taken if a problem arises. This has generated an altogether new area of research, which seeks possible solutions for securing the devices, and communication amongst them. Internet of Things Security: Fundamentals, Techniques and Applications provides a comprehensive overview of the overall scenario of IoT Security whilst highlighting recent research and applications in the field.

Images can be processed to enhance their subjective content or to extract useful information. One of the earliest applications of digital image processing was for transmitting digitised newspaper pictures across the Atlantic Ocean in the early 1920s. While there are many possible sensors that can be used for imaging, this chapter focuses on optical images captured from visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A real‐time imaging system is one that regularly captures images, analyses those images to obtain some data, and then uses that data to control some activity. An embedded system is a computer system that is embedded within a product or component.
