Usually, it has to develop a new ADL for a particular domain. Some domains are difficult to develop the ADLs, e.g. data processing domain (DPD). Since the products of these domains can apply to many different areas as a sub module, which complicates the architecture abstraction. This paper shows the development of our ADL for data processing domain. It has domain independence meta model concept, and it supports variability description and the code generation rules have been indicated too. Our data processing product line can be described by this ADL and generate product code, which will improve the productivity.","","978-1-4244-6271-1","10.1109/ITNG.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501510","ADL;software product line;MDA;DSM;software architecture","Architecture description languages;Data processing;Software architecture;Computer architecture;Productivity;DSL;Guidelines;Data mining;Space technology;Information technology","","1","","9","IEEE","1 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, the architecture description of the SPL is essential to make it clear how the architecture realizes the feature model and to represent both domain and application engineering architectural artifacts. Moreover, it is important to establish the association between the architectural specification and the artifacts involved in the SPL development process towards code generation. In this paper, we present Arch SPL-MDD, a model-driven strategy to support explicit modeling and automatic management of variabilities in SPLs. Arch SPL-MDD is associated to a generic process with systematic activities aimed to generate customized source code from the product configuration. Furthermore, the proposed strategy uses the Light PL-ACME architecture description language to support the architectural specification of the SPL, which is input of model transformations towards automatically generating SPL products. To evaluate the efficiency and applicability of Arch SPL-MDD, we conducted a controlled experiment by using Ginga For All, an SPL for the Ginga digital TV middleware.","","978-1-4673-9630-1","10.1109/SBCARS.2015.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306134","software product lines;variability management;model-driven development;model transformation;architecture description language;code generation","Computer architecture;Tuners;Unified modeling language;Digital TV;Middleware;Hardware","","3","","26","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for deriving new product variants that are built upon existing ones, the presence of a single model describing the architecture of the whole system with an explicit specification of commonality and variability is of great interest. Indeed, this enables them to see the invariant part of the whole, on top of which new functionality can be built, in addition to the different options they can use. We investigate in this work the use of software product line reverse engineering approaches, and in particular the framework named But4Reuse, for recovering an architecture model that enables us to build a Software Architecture Product Line (SAPL), from a set of software variants. We propose a generic process for recovering an architecture model of such a product line.

Data collection is a domain which evolved to use mobile devices to collect information, targeting different fields of study including: physical and social sciences, humanities, business, demographic surveys, agriculture, biology, and geology. Android usually runs on different hardware and software domains with similar functional and non-functional features. The data collection domain has a lot of sub-domains, creating an opportunity to explore software variability and quality properties such as reliability, availability, and data integrity using Component-Based Development (CBD), Fault Tolerance Techniques and Software Product Line (SPL) with Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). However, the use of mobile application for data collection poses some challenges like severe hardware restrictions (such as limited power processing and short battery lifetime) and the use of sophisticated techniques can negatively impact in application performance, and quality properties. In this work, these issues were addressed by proposing the development of a robust SPL architecture called Robust SPL for Data Collection (R-SPL-DC) and a real application called E-Phenology Collector for data collection domain to assess the use fault tolerance techniques, CBD, SPL, and AOSD to ensure availability, reliability, and data integrity without significant impacts on the overall performance of the mobile device.

In this work we propose a “Fast Data” architecture for a specific kind of software application in which input data arrive very fast and the results for each processed data have to match such input rates. We applied this architecture to build a Dashboard for Anomalous Traffic Analysis in Data Networks. In order to fulfill the requirements of Real-Time processing and no data losses, we carry out a design that consists of a pattern of dynamic tree of process pipelines, where the number of branches increases proportionally to the input data rate. Two different approaches have been followed to implement this design pattern: one based in a well-known set of products from the Big Data ecosystem; and the other built with Kafka, Zookeeper and a set of components designed and implemented by us. These two implementations have been compared in terms of velocity and scalability performance. As a result, the implementation built with our own components is significantly faster and scalable than the traditional one. The good results obtained by using both the design pattern of dynamic tree of process pipelines and our implementation make them very suitable for its use in other scenarios and applications such as smart cities, environment monitoring, industry 4.0, distributed control systems, etc.","","978-1-5090-2641-8","10.1109/ICDIM.2016.7829756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829756","Fast Data;Big Data;Data-Driven;Continuous Data Processing;Stream Processing;Scalability","Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Pipelines;Databases;Architecture;Big data;Scalability","","1","","18","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to new challenges with respect to architecture development as interconnections between features are introduced that are not yet fully understood. The vehicle's system architecture evolves from towards a distributed multi-functional control system. Component oriented, model based approaches with multiple viewpoints have already proven being suitable in other domains to manage the dependencies between functionality by decomposing a system into a network of functional entities encapsulated in components. In this paper, we present a domain-specific component model to describe functional interdependencies as well as non-functional requirements needed to enable safe integration of software components in a centralized automotive ICT architecture. The model enables the composition of high-level functions and the definition of compatibility constraints. The approach is then applied to unveil feature interaction in a component architecture. This forms the foundation of a sound development and integration process for heavily interconnected functions. It also enables online product validation mechanisms to ensure functional integrity and safety as well as meeting of deployment constraints and timing requirements.","","978-1-4799-6075-0","10.1109/IEVC.2014.7056210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056210","","Computer architecture;Vehicles;Software;Component architectures;Ports (Computers);Safety;Complexity theory","","3","","16","IEEE","9 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general terms, existing solutions for MD-PLE support high-level model refinement into lower level abstractions in order to reach code implementation of product line architectures. Nevertheless, the applicability of such approaches is limited due to either the unsystematic processes that do not clearly specify how to refine models to decrease the level of abstraction, or the lack of automation support. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure for MD-PLE. The infrastructure encompasses a model-driven, systematic and semi-automated engineering method that combines a set of existing process, tools, languages and models to implement product line architectures. Common Variability Language (CVL) is adopted to specify and resolve architectural variability explicitly and systematically.

This RA has imbedded the domain knowledge on architectural style(s), main functionality and quality properties. Due to the difficulty of measuring quality properties at architecture design stage, an heuristic is proposed to derive an optimal feasible solution from the weights assigned to architectural choices based on this knowledge and customer requirements. Our results, that are applied to the Integrated Healthcare Information System domain, offer a practical and straightforward way of deriving SPL products that can be partially automatized, and can also be useful from a didactical point of view, to show a complete product derivation process from RA that is often missing to illustrate known approaches.","","978-1-4673-9557-1","10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317382","software product lines;product derivation;quality requirements;quality model;reference architecture;bottom-up process","Connectors;Engines;Interoperability;Internet;Medical diagnostic imaging;Graphical user interfaces;Standards","","3","","17","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A new digital specialized design component is constructed for the integration of design resources, and different user interfaces are customized for different resource versions. And then process template is designed for process-variable heterogeneous design data management and reuse. A process template centered design data integrated management architecture is designed which can provide an operational environment for the merge of engineering management and project management; it also implements design data and component reuse across different design projects.

By employing microservices to refactor our product line, we are now able to follow a divide-and-conquer strategy to maximize the reusability of component business capacities and create satellite remote sensing products at a much faster pace. This paper mainly introduces our microservice-oriented product line, and the data-analytics-visualization (DAV) pattern for logically organizing and managing relevant microservices of different products.

Model is based on enterprise architecture units called domains and smaller units called functional components. Applied domain model divide the complete business of a telecommunication company in to 12 domains where each domain represents a “natural” unit with clear responsibilities and competencies structured according to the business aspects. Although data ownership comprises several important responsibilities, approach taken in this paper is manly in respect to authorization of user access to data and validation of approved access. We propose to determine of which functional components information or network system is consistent of and that each functional component has to have an owner assigned. Owner of functional components becomes data owner of the applications which implements that functionality due to the fact that each functional component has its own data.","","978-953-233-068-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240896","","Customer relationship management;Data models;Companies;Telecommunications;Authorization","","","","8","","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasing volatility requires fast innovation cycles whereas uncertainty and ambiguity prevent companies from knowing what customers really want. To anticipate eventually upcoming requirements, a vast amount of products and product variants is developed and offered to the market. Due to increasing complexity, the effort, i.e. costs, for product realization rises especially in indirect areas, which cannot be allocated correctly to the causing variants. On the one hand side, this is because of deficits of commonly used cost calculation systems. On the other hand side, it's because of the high effort for introducing and maintaining advanced costing systems, such as Process Cost Calculation or Time-driven Activity-based Costing and, as those are almost interview-based, their low accuracy and timeliness. Digitalization in all areas of manufacturing companies enables the collection of event data, which are already used e.g. by Process Mining. The aim of this paper is to use event data in order to enable a low-effort but increased accurate and timely Time-driven Activity-based Costing by using Process Data Mining. Therefore, the required event data as well as the corresponding data model is presented and it's described how to evaluate the data for Time-driven Activity-based Costing.","","978-1-6654-4091-2","10.1109/TEMSCON-EUR52034.2021.9488654","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488654","Time-driven Activity-based Costing;Process Data Mining;Cost calculation;Data Science","Technological innovation;Uncertainty;Costing;Europe;Companies;Data models;Manufacturing","","1","","40","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, reference architecture is a special type of architecture that captures the essence of software systems of a specific domain, achieving therefore well-recognized understanding of that domain. In spite of this, it is not observed concern in order to widely disseminate reference architectures and, as a consequence, the knowledge encompassed by these architectures. At the same time, Open Source Software (OSS) has been largely developed and used in both academy and industry. A diversity of OSS has been made available and has contributed to the software development through dissemination of knowledge that is encompassed mainly in the source code. Specifically, its success is due to OSS licences that have adequately supported its development and evolution. Thus, applying this same idea in order to disseminate reference architectures seems to be very interesting. The main contribution of this paper is to propose Open Source Reference Architecture (OSRA) that, based on principles of OSS, aims at promoting dissemination and evolution of reference architectures, intending to contribute to a more effective software development.","","978-0-7695-4626-1","10.1109/SBCARS.2011.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114567","Reference Architecture;Open Source;Open Source License","Computer architecture;Licenses;Testing;Software architecture;Unified modeling language;Software systems","","","","58","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In software engineering, we often produce unique tools for experiments and evaluate them independently on different data sets. In this paper, we present KernelHaven as an experimentation workbench supporting a significant number of experiments in the domain of static product line analysis and verification. It addresses the need for extracting information from a variety of artifacts in this domain by means of an open plug-in infrastructure. Available plug-ins encapsulate existing tools, which can now be combined efficiently to yield new analyses. As an experimentation workbench, it provides configuration-based definitions of experiments, their documentation, and technical services, like parallelization and caching. Hence, researchers can abstract from technical details and focus on the algorithmic core of their research problem. KernelHaven supports different types of analyses, like correctness checks, metrics, etc., in its specific domain.

Pocket Code is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for the brick based visual programming language Catrobat. It is released in various flavors for different partners and projects (e.g., Create@School, Phiro and Standalone). All flavors use the same code base but slightly differ in design and functionality. If different flavors are maintained as separate projects, all projects require proper maintenance. Any feature introduced or updated in one project must be ported to all others, for that they dont diverge. With an increase in the number of flavors, efforts to maintain will also increase which renders the project unmaintainable. If all flavors are maintained in one project, it is challenging to release more than one version of an application with a different set of functionalities and different user interface (UI) enhancements. In this paper, Pocket Code's different build variants are discussed particularly the standalone build variant. To build a standalone version of any app hosted on the Pocket Code sharing platform, the user has to trigger the build via the web interface on the remote Pocket Code server. Resource files and app configuration are generated based on user input.

The hybrid architecture is quantitatively compared with five state-of-the-art AC and DC architectures in terms of efficiencies, reliabilities and cost. The evaluations are based on the most recent AC and DC distribution component data of efficiency, reliability and cost, meanwhile taking into account the entire power distribution path from Medium Voltage (MV) AC input to server 12V DC.

In this research, we use the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dataset as an example to explore the effectiveness of diverse time series analysis methods and advanced deep learning techniques for forecasting. It’s important to note that our model is capable of handling numerous such datasets, making it a versatile tool for time series analysis and forecasting. Our comprehensive methodology encompasses collecting data from sources like the FRED API, preprocessing the dataset, and systematically applying a wide array of methods. These methods include traditional time series analysis, ARIMA models, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. Our findings highlight the power of modern RNN architectures, such as the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, in capturing the intricacies within time series data, exemplified here by the GDP dataset. These deep learning techniques, when applied to various datasets, exhibit remarkable accuracy and the potential to provide valuable insights for data-driven decision-making. While traditional time series analysis methods may have limitations in modeling the complex and dynamic nature of temporal data, they still offer valuable insights. This research contributes to the broader discourse in time series analysis, emphasizing the significance of modern deep learning techniques when dealing with intricate time series data. It provides a robust framework for practitioners and researchers to navigate the complexities of time series data analysis and underscores the utility of integrating these techniques for enhanced forecasting capabilities.

With the rapid development of big data technology and the accumulation of user behavior data, the product recommendation system of online mall has also become the core of the recommendation system. At present, a variety of recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation and deep learning, have been widely studied and applied. Online mall product recommendation needs to have real-time, can quickly respond to user interaction and changes in commodity inventory. Therefore, the recommendation system needs to have efficient algorithm and technology, as well as reasonable system architecture to support real-time recommendation service. However, in the past, the product recommendation system in the online mall was often simple and limited. Simple methods such as popularity-based, content-based and collaborative filtering are mainly used for recommendation, but there are some problems such as insufficient personalization and inaccurate characterization of user characteristics. Traditional recommendation systems tend to recommend products to users that they already like, but this can lead to problems of information filtering and user interest limitation. In addition, the traditional recommendation method is still based on the similarity of product content to recommend products with similar characteristics to users through the analysis of product text description, label and other information. However, this traditional approach still has its limitations in the face of complex product classification systems and detailed characterization of user preferences. Therefore, by aggregating the feature information from the neighbors of the central node in the graph and combining the aggregated information with the current representation of the central node, this paper achieves the purpose of updating the representation of the central node in the graph neural network (GNN), and enables the machine learning algorithm to learn new tasks adaptively without redesigning and training the model. The neuronal attention aggregation layer (GMFA) is proposed. Finally, the experimental comparison proves that the combination of meta-learning and graph neural network has great effectiveness and feasibility.","","979-8-3503-0637-8","10.1109/CSECS60003.2023.10428411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10428411","product recommendation;graph neural network;meta-learning;attention aggregation layer","Training;Collaborative filtering;Systems architecture;Graph neural networks;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Recommender systems","","","","20","IEEE","16 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Decision making requires multiple analytical engines suitable for each type of data, programming languages, algorithms, visualization tools, and user interfaces. More often than not, industrial analytics is conducted ad hoc by lashing together analytics components such as distributed data sources, analytics engines, and algorithms. This kind of piecemeal approach ignores scale, security, governance, reliability, model management and fault tolerance that are paramount for industrial strength analytics. A unified, versatile, and robust architecture that combines various components in a single integrated platform is the need of the hour. Teradata Vantage (TD Vantage) is such a platform for delivering production quality enterprise analytics at scale. In this paper, we outline the proposed TD Vantage (available in the market and under continuous development) that unifies data, engines, and algorithms operating in a seamless symphony. We will demonstrate its capabilities through three proofs of concept biz: image data using TensorFlow, text data using Spark, and transaction data using Aster (now renamed Machine Learning Engine or MLE), with Teradata orchestrating interactions among the various components.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006321","Integrated Analytics Platform;Machine Learning;Artificial Intelligence;Analytics Engines;Text Analysis by NLP;Image Recognition","Engines;Sparks;Machine learning;Tools;Maximum likelihood estimation;Distributed databases","","2","","16","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the life cycle of a product family, the amount of derived product variants increase due to numerous internal and external driven reasons. This leads to additional complexity within the product family as variety and the dynamics raise. This paper presents an approach to evaluate the additional complexity costs, originating from changes within the product family. The approach combines change-propagation methods with cost calculation methods. The approach differentiates between costs based on changes of existing variants and costs based on changes leading to substituting or additional variants. Variety-inducing change drivers are assigned to affected product components and functions. All affected components, especially the indirectly changed-ones, are identified by domain-spanning change propagation. This incorporates geometrical and functional dependencies between components. Running as well as one-time expenses are determined by a process-based costing system taking into account the required additional processes and their duration to handle the added complexity. The approach is implemented into a software tool, using data of an industrial product family. An industrial case study is conducted for evaluation of the approach and the tool. Exemplary changes showed that the amount of cost caused by indirect changed components represents about half of the total complexity costs.","","978-1-4799-5927-3","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116726","complexity costs;engineering changes;change propagation;product family","Complexity theory;Costing;Context;Mathematical model;Manufacturing;Interviews;Industries","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore it is a challenge to select the optimum components from a component library that will satisfy all functional and non-functional system requirements.

Because these factors of influence and their effects are mostly unknown at the beginning of the project, they are considered insufficiently during the planning phase. In this context, expert interviews are chosen as the method for determining the influencing factors. It is a matter to structure these factors categorically to provide a basis for the systematic transfer of identified future influences into the model.

Recently, sentiment analysis is employed to assess user opinions on products by extracting valuable insights regarding various features and benefits. These reviews are widely distributed to leverage and disseminate user perspectives, providing valuable information on user sentiments in comment sections to differentiate positive and negative feedback. With the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, detecting fake reviews has become imperative to ensure the authenticity of user opinions. To address this, a fuzzy-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to differentiate genuine and fake product reviews based on user opinions and their review across similar products. The proposed architecture is designed to be resilient to temporal changes in user behavior. Initially, data preprocessing is performed to obtain user profile and product characteristics and parse statements. The preprocessed data is then subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract features representing user intentions. These features are given as input to the fuzzy-based CNN to analyze user behavior across various aspects. The obtained optimal behavioral data is utilized to train the fuzzy-optimized CNN, which provide valuable predictions on changes in user opinion towards different products. The proposed architecture employs convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected networks for review classification and fake review prediction. Performance evaluation on an Amazon product review dataset demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure compared to conventional architectures.","","979-8-3503-8579-3","10.1109/ICOECA62351.2024.00125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10612355","Product Review;Online Social Networks;Fuzzy Optimized Convolution Neural Network;Principle Component Analysis;Sentiment Analysis","Sentiment analysis;Accuracy;Reviews;Convolution;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Fake news","","","","20","IEEE","5 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, to make an architecture design, presented practices include: understanding relevant domains, requirements engineering, architecture definition. The strengths and weaknesses of Face book architecture are evaluated with the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). As a result of applying a framework for SPL practice, layered view and component-based view are illustrated along with variabilities represented by Product Line UML-based Software Engineering (PLUS) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). Based on the analysis of requirements of SNS, additional services such as file sharing and instant messaging are represented as optional components. In case of Face book, three key quality attributes, i.e., availability, scalability, and privacy are analyzed by using quality attribute utility tree.

The MVP concept has influenced the way in which development teams apply Software Engineering (SE) practices. However, the overall understanding of this influence of MVPs on SE practices is still poor. [Objective] Our goal is to characterize the publication landscape on practices that have been used in the context of software MVPs. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study using a hybrid search strategy that consists of a database search and parallel forward and backward snowballing. [Results] We identified 33 papers, published between 2013 and 2020. We observed some trends related to MVP ideation and evaluation practices. For instance, regarding ideation, we found six different approaches (e.g., Design Thinking, Lean Inception) and mainly informal end-user involvement practices (e.g., workshops, interviews). For evaluation there is an emphasis on end-user validations based on practices such as usability tests, A/B testing, and usage data analysis. However, there is still limited research related to MVP technical feasibility assessment and effort estimation. We also observed a lack of scientific rigor in many of the identified studies. [Conclusion] Our analysis suggests that there are opportunities for solution proposals to address gaps concerning technical feasibility assessment and effort estimation. Also, more effort needs to be invested into empirically evaluating the existing MVP-related practices.","","978-1-6654-2705-0","10.1109/SEAA53835.2021.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582602","MVP;minimum viable product;software engineering;systematic mapping","Systematics;Data analysis;Conferences;Estimation;Search problems;Software;Usability","","2","","22","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the types of data that needs to be analyzed is market consumer behavior data in online shops, generated in the form of clickstream data. Currently, there was not any research that examines the determination of clickstream data components, clickstream data recording mechanism, and how to analyze clickstream data components in online shops properly. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed online shop application, the module to record the clickstream data, and the method to analyze the clickstream data. Based on our evaluation, eight clickstream data components were successfully recorded in the database using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology. The clickstream data component that contains market customer behavior data is Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) data and has been analyzed using the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) ranking method.","","978-1-7281-9747-0","10.1109/ICITech50181.2021.9590161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590161","Clickstream data;customer behavior;AJAX;MCDM;SAW","Consumer behavior;Data analysis;Databases;Surface acoustic waves;Decision making;Web and internet services;XML","","","","18","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a lot of research has been done on how to bring functional requirements into the software, non-functional requirements are still challenging. One of the reasons is that non-functional requirements are often hard to measure and hard to test. Unfortunately, security, privacy, and data protections are such non-functional requirements. To make things even more complicate, software engineering is a social process. This means multiple parties (i.e., security experts, software architects, and programmers) have to work together, which will result unavoidable in misunderstandings and misinterpretation. Therefore, it is often not clear if security concerns are implemented correctly, or have been at least formalized correctly for later implementation during the requirement analysis. This paper is a discussion starter, on how to overcome communication-based problems, ensure that security concerns are implemented correctly, and how to avoid software erosion that later on breaks security concerns. Therefore, we discuss strategies which combine security concepts with software engineering methods by the intensive use of models. Such models are already used in academia and even in industry. We recommend to use models more often, more intensive, and for more concerns.","","978-1-5386-5862-8","10.1109/SC2.2017.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8315383","Security;Software Engineering;Model;Security Concept;Model-based;Privacy;Data Protection;Model-driven;Threat Modeling;Palladio Component Model","Software;Software architecture;Data models;Analytical models;Encryption","","4","","8","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that, first, we proposed 4 types of X-DSM matrices that are used to represent the components, design parameters, activities and the associated project's stakeholders. And then, we use SysML language diagrams to represent the behavioral views of the product at different stages of its lifecycle. The proposed metamodel complies with the SysML formalism including both the 7 UML4SysML views and 2 additional views aimed to the care of Specifications and Parametric settings. These last two views are key factors for modeling products with multiple configurations.

Prominent languages include R, Python, and Matlab. On the other hand, analysts aim to compute mathematical models as fast as possible, especially with large data sets. Data summarization remains a fundamental technique to accelerate machine learning computations. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel summarization mechanism computed via a single matrix multiplication in the statistical R language. We show our summarization benefits a large family of linear models, including Linear Regression, PCA, and Naive Bayes. We present a subsystem that enables exploiting summarization by detecting Gramian matrix products in R. We optimize the existing R source code by overriding the internal R matrix multiplication algorithm using ours. Our solution can be plugged into R and help solving where a similar matrix multiplication appears, much faster and without RAM limitations. Moreover, our solution can be benefited from the parallel processing ability of the summarization matrix. We present an experimental validation showing our subsystem incurs little overhead since it works on source code while providing much faster speeds compared to the R language built-in functions. To round up our comparisons, we also compare our subsystem with Spark in parallel machines. For our solution, we assume that data can be in the HDFS, disk, or already partitioned. Our solution triumphs Spark in most cases proving we can also compete in the big data space.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378399","R;Summarization Operator;Matrix Multiplication;Machine Learning","R language;Big Data;Parallel processing;Sparks;Python;Principal component analysis;Matlab","","3","","18","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The market is expected to grow to about 28,000 aircraft by 2018. IT and software solutions should be at the heart of the automation and the optimization of such promising and sensitive industry. However, there is no generally-accepted software architecture to facilitate the MRO operations. The industry is dependent on architectures which are mostly propriety and have varying success and acceptance. A general MRO architecture could be of great significance, as modern aircrafts have a long life expectancy that can exceed 30 years, and definitely will need routine/none-routine MRO operations over their lifespan. Due to which, there is a growing need for a well-defined architecture to help reduce the costs, and standardize the overall MRO operations. Therefore, the goal of the stream of this research is to define and formalize a generalized software-solution architecture for MROs. This study proposes a general Client-Cloud architecture, reflecting the main MRO functional and quality requirements to enhance the business's overall performance and success. The study also made an effort to formally define the model, introduced by the proposed architecture, using Acme as an ADL1010Architecture Description Language.

Synaptic weights of RBFNN output layer need to be updated whenever the FR system comes across a new face to be learnt. For real-time on-line learning, update of synaptic weights is done using an existing Incremental Pseudo Inverse (IPI) algorithm in the place of compute intensive pseudo inverse algorithm.

In the frame of the EU funded Teaming.AI project, we identified the monitoring of teaming aspects in human-AI collaboration, the runtime monitoring and validation of ethical policies, and the support for experimentation with data and machine learning algorithms as the most relevant challenges for human-AI teaming in smart manufacturing. Based on these challenges, we developed a reference software architecture based on knowledge graphs, tracking and scene analysis, and components for relational machine learning with a particular focus on its scalability. Our approach uses knowledge graphs to capture product and process specific knowledge in the manufacturing process and to utilize it for relational machine learning. This allows for context-specific recommendations for actions in the manufacturing process for the optimization of product quality and the prevention of physical harm. The empirical validation of this software architecture will be conducted in cooperation with three large-scale companies in the automotive, energy systems, and precision machining domain.

Digital twins are one of the key technologies in the realization of such business models. In most cases, digital twins are already created in the early product development/engineering phases and continue to develop over the lifetime of the product. Particularly in engineering, there is already an intensive exchange of different parts of the digital twin within and across company boundaries (for example, between component manufacturers and system providers all the way to the customer/operator). This usually leads to different IT ecosystems for different stakeholders and industries. Standardized exchange of data is therefore essential to ensure a secure, trustworthy and efficient exchange of data within the enterprise IT and the value chain. This is where the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) comes to play. Using the example of a data management system, this contribution illustrates the various applications inside and outside the enterprise engineering IT of the Asset Administration Shell (e.g. import and export of Assets via Gaia-X-compliant data spaces or also just file-based) and discusses the respective use cases in more detail using concrete examples from projects funded by the BMBF, BMWK, EIT Manufacturing and the EU.

The quality features are extracted from the spectral characteristics obtained from the overall measuring range of the spectrophotometer and from the selected frequency band of the hyperspectral characteristics. They are represented by the first three Principal Components. The possibility for distinct assessment of the time of storage is evaluated by the separation accuracy of the spectral data for different days of storage.

However, this results in the emergence of on-demand manufacturing as well as the provision of personalized goods and services, produced in the context of shortened innovation cycles. However, the downside of this trend is the uprising complexity that appears when engineering such systems. Thus, the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been developed by several German associations in order to cope with the complexity of such cross-disciplinary systems. However, at the current point of view, this framework is exhibiting a gap between the architectural model and actual industrial applications. Thus, this paper introduces an approach proposing Round-trip Engineering (RTE) of previously modeled industrial system components. In order to do so, first the information and communication architecture is modeled according to the specifications of RAMI 4.0 and by utilizing OPC UA. Subsequently, the modeled components are generated and applied with the help of FREDOSAR, an open-source system architecture aimed for the application in such a complex system. In the end, data exchange between RAMI 4.0 and the industrial application is established by realizing a bidirectional interface, which is evaluated with a typical industrial case study.","2687-8828","978-1-7281-8602-3","10.1109/ISSE49799.2020.9272026","Christian Doppler Research Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272026","System Architecture;OPC UA;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Round-trip Engineering (RTE)","Adaptation models;Computer architecture;Manufacturing;Production;Industries;Data models;Complexity theory","","","","18","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these components are rarely interconnected or are only linked via manufacturer-specific, proprietary interfaces. This hinders changes to and extensions of platform components. Often platform modifications are only possible with the help of the original integrator, which complicates a seamless integration of new components. In order to unify the interfaces of sub-systems and enhance platform interoperability, several open architecture initiatives have been launched on national and multi-national levels. Some as the NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture (NGVA) have already recognised that new approaches for system verification and acceptance need to be considered. Nevertheless, these considerations are still on the conceptual level and no tools for rigorous interface conformity testing are yet in place. This paper describes a concept supporting the testing of interface specifications in early standardisation phases as well as the verification of platform architecture implementations in actual systems later on. On the example of the NGVA, a test framework is presented focussing on the reuse of test artefacts from early specification checking for later conformance and final acceptance testing. The approach is validated by means of a case study supporting the NGVA standardisation.","","978-1-5090-5666-8","10.1109/MILTECHS.2017.7988742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988742","Military Open Architectures;Open System Architectures;Verification;Validation;Acceptance Testing;Model Checking;Test Framework;NATO Generic Vehicle Architecture","Testing;Standards;Computer architecture;Interoperability;Tools;Protocols;Open systems","","5","","28","IEEE","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Key Technology for Big Visual Data Analysis in Security Space and Its Applications","R.

Although in recent years significant progress has been achieved in biometric identification technology, the progress of single technologies does not dramatically improve the overall performance or solve the system-level problems of social security. Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is"" social structure and social activities"", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion. Also we strive to become the internationally leading industry in the field of big security data analysis.","","978-1-5090-3677-6","10.1109/CBD.2016.065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815231","big visual data;security space;social security","Security;Sensors;Visualization;Big data;Object recognition;Surveillance;Data analysis","","3","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such selection relies on human judgment, possibly supported by structured prioritization techniques and tools. Goal: Our goal was to investigate whether certain attributes of prioritization techniques affect stakeholders' threshold for judging product features as essential. The four investigated techniques represent four combinations of granularity (low, high) and cognitive support (low, high). Method: To control for robustness and masking effects when investigating in the field, we conducted both an artificial experiment and a field experiment using the same prioritization techniques. In the artificial experiment, 94 subjects in four treatment groups indicated the features (from a list of 16) essential when buying a new cell phone. In the field experiment, 44 domain experts indicated the software product features that were essential for the fulfillment of the project's vision. The effects of granularity and cognitive support on the number of essential ratings were analyzed and compared between the experiments. Result: With lower granularity, significantly more features were rated as essential. The effect was large in the general experiment and extreme in the field experiment. Added cognitive support had medium effect, but worked in opposite directions in the two experiments, and was not statistically significant in the field experiment. Implications: Software projects should avoid taking stakeholders' judgments of essentiality at face value. Practices and tools should be designed to counteract biases and to support the conscious knowledge-based elements of prioritizing.","1949-3789","978-1-4503-1056-7","10.1145/2372251.2372300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475427","Requirements;Prioritization techniques;Essential features;Stakeholders;Field experiment;Robustness","Software;Context;Accuracy;Robustness;Software engineering;Estimation","","2","","38","","7 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper presents a proposed methodology for face recognition based on preprocessing face images using Belief Propagation segmentation algorithm. The algorithm has been tested on 50 subjects (100 images). The proposed method first was tested on ESSEX face database and next on own segmented face database. Test results gave a recognition rate of about 84% for ESSEX database and 90% for our segmented database.

To achieve this, a locally available gateway running the software Node-RED is used, to receive the data from the different machines and forward it to a central server using MQTT, for example. On this server, the data is stored in the time series database InfluxDB and is consequently available for analysis via Grafana. A particular focus lies on the independent software components, which can be easily exchanged and combined in other ways. Thus, choosing this software means that you won't be affected by the vendor lock-in that is common in the market.

Still, the architectural model of such systems can be rather large and the manual creation of the model is both time-consuming and error-prone. Also, the manually crafted and maintained architectural model easily becomes inconsistent with the actual system implementation because the model is often not updated as the system architecture evolves. A solution to this problem is the technique of architecture recovery that extracts models directly from source code. In this paper, we describe an approach to architecture recovery based on a software structure model that forms the basis of a component-based build system. Extracted models are known to correspond to the underlying code as consistency of the structure model with source code is inevitable for the system's build process to succeed. The approach and supporting tools have been successfully applied at Ericsson for a complex telecommunication product that consists of several millions of lines of C/C++ code.","","978-1-5090-2131-4","10.1109/WICSA.2016.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516817","architecture recovery;system modeling;component models","Unified modeling language;Ports (Computers);Software;Connectors;Computer architecture;Containers;Protocols","","7","","12","IEEE","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the increasing complexity of the embedded control software, significant delays can occur in development programs or even errors can be present in the control software of the final product. In the development of the electric and electronic system (E/E system), the analysis and specification for the architecture of the logical system, technical system and software itself includes many repetitive (manual) processes. Those repetitive processes are time consuming and are prone to errors. This research proposes new methods and tools that allow the designer to take electronic components, including control software, into account already in the conceptual design stage of complex systems. These new methods are based upon the principles of Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE), which is essentially a combination of computer aided design (CAD) and artificial intelligence (AI). The proposed methods can establish the relationship from the logical system architecture to the technical system architecture and finally the software components. Moreover, the proposed tools can model the logical, technical architecture and automatically generate the software components. The software language GDL, which is particularly suitable for the representation of complex systems and the development of KBE applications, has been used to develop the tools. The development of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) for a novel electric vehicle configuration has been chosen as test case. Based on a single intelligent product model, that contains the main design parameters of the vehicle specified by the designer, two models are generated automatically; (1) the simulation model of the physical plant and the associated control system, and (2) the control software. For a specific vehicle configuration, the simulation model can be used to test the control system and to optimize the parameters of the control system. In the case of an ABS, a braking maneuver is simulated. Next, the software components are generated automatically. The simulation model is used to test the software components for a range of conditions. The results show that the of the software components are automatically updated when the physical plant of the E/E systems or top level overall design changes. The final source code is well-structured and easy to understand due to the fact that there is a direct relation between the vehicle design parameters specified in the original product model and the variables and their values in the data model of the software components. The proposed design methods and tools can in principle be applied to any dynamic system with a high level of software integration, such as e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles.","2155-7209","978-1-4799-1538-5","10.1109/DASC.2013.6712633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6712633","","Software;Data models;Vehicles;Wheels;Solid modeling;Control systems;Computer architecture","","2","","10","IEEE","23 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sensors in an IoT network provide data on the environment in which they are deployed and interact with other devices and the applications in the broader IoT ecosystem. IoT components do not necessarily adhere to the same standard and so can be very heterogeneous in a particular environment. This can create challenges in the collection and monitoring of heterogeneous data in real-time as well as monitoring the infrastructure itself. Such data collection is not only important for the analysis of the environment but also for monitoring the health of the devices and operational components, such as software elements.

As a product is mostly offered in different variants, product platforms are applied for the efficient development and manufacturing of product families. By product platforms, economies of scale are achieved by e.g. common parts or modules, always facing the trade-off of differentiation. In the light of the above mentioned changes, this paper presents an approach how external changes can be anticipated by the combination of an expert-based and data-based method for identifying the required flexibility of a product platform.

In this way, the measurement task is separated into a group of measurement components, which are connected together by data bus. The platform configures the measurement task by component language and carries out management of the measurement process by information exchange protocols and data exchange protocols. Based on the data bus, the measurement data can propagate among the configured data flow ways asynchronously, in the process; users can plug and unplug any components to the measurement platform.

A key component in the development of these systems is the ability to represent data analytics variability, which captures the ways in which the system can adapt in terms of the data analysis at design and run times. Although variability has been explored in the domain of software product lines (SPLs), data analytics variability in IoT neural network-based systems still seems to be poorly understood and needs to be investigated appropriately. In this paper, we introduce an approach to capture data analytics variability in IoT neural network-based systems (IoTNNSs).

Aiming at the goals, this paper proposes a multi-task learning model with an encoder-decoder architecture augmented by the matrix factorization technique and the attention mechanism. Our model design brings two major advantages. First, by jointly considering the input multivariate time series reconstruction task and the quality prediction in a multi-task learning model, the performance of the quality prediction task is boosted. Second, by incorporating the matrix factorization technique, we enable the proposed model to pay/learn attentions on the component of the multivariate time series rather than on the time axis. With the attention on components, the correlation between a sensor reading and a final quality measure can be quantized to improve the model interpretability. Comprehensive performance evaluation on real data sets is conducted. The experimental results validate that strengths of the proposed model on quality prediction and model interpretability.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731458","Early stage prediction, quality prediction, neural network, deep learning, multi task learning, encoder decoder, attention mechanism","Task analysis;Time series analysis;Predictive models;Quality assessment;Product design;Decoding","","7","1","30","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the importance of matrix computation, it has been widely studied for many years. In the Big Data ear, as the scale of the matrix grows, traditional single-node matrix computation systems can hardly cope with such large data and computation. Existing distributed matrix computation solutions are still not efficient enough, or have poor fault tolerance and usability. In this paper, we propose Marlin, an efficient distributed matrix computation library which is built on top of Spark. Marlin contains several distributed matrix operation algorithms and provides high-level matrix computation primitives for users. In Marlin, we proposed three distributed matrix multiplication algorithms for different situations. Based on this, we designed an adaptive model to choose the best approach for different problems. Moreover, to improve the computation performance, instead of naively using Spark, we put forward some optimizations including taking advantage of the native linear algebra library, reducing shuffle communication and increasing parallelism. Experimental results show that Marlin is over an order of magnitude faster than R (a widely-used statistical computing system) and the existing distributed matrix operation algorithms based on MapReduce. Moreover, Marlin achieves comparable performance to the specialized MPI-based matrix multiplication algorithm SUMMA but uses a general dataflow engine and gains common dataflow features such as scalability and fault tolerance.","","978-1-4799-9926-2","10.1109/BigData.2015.7364023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364023","matrix computation;parallel algorithm;inmemory computing;Spark","Sparks;Libraries;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Big data;Algorithm design and analysis;Linear algebra","","13","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the problem of how to combine SPLE with Model-Based System Engineering is still a challenge, as systems are much broader than the software domain. Unlike software engineering, system engineering has to consider the physical resources aspect. This paper classifies typical types of physical variability and provides general modelling solutions for each type of physical variation at the system design stage. Specifically, this approach combines a variability model with a SysML Block Definition Diagram and an Internal Block Diagram to model the contextual variability, architectural variability, connector variability, instance number variability, component variability, location variability and evolutional variability of physical designs. Variability is modelled separately to help reduce the complexity of design models.

While the benefits of open systems are well understood across the DoD, there are still challenges in implementing an OSA. Among these is a lack of a clearly defined functional modularization method suitable for open systems. The goal of this research is to aid system architects in adopting an open approach by developing a methodology to identify candidate components that can form the basis of modular architectures. This will support the development of strategic OSA reuse plans through identifying common functional components that support stakeholder objectives in terms of strategic design attributes such as flexibility, extensibility, scalability, and reconfigurability.

Based on this, this paper proposes a digital twin-based automated control method for whole life cycle aircraft assembly quality data, which improves the efficiency and reliability of alignment quality analysis. Firstly, the distribution of quality data in the aircraft alignment process and how it is specifically applied are sorted out. Secondly, a multi-tier architecture of the digital twin system was constructed.

Compared with existing metadata, where variable labels in a dataset are listed, the presented metadata, called data leaf (DL), includes events, situations, and/or actions that, as a set, compose scenarios supposed to be active in the target real world of a dataset. This method considers the fitness of metadata corresponding to various datasets to a feature concept (FC), which provides an abstract illustration of the knowledge acquired or expected to be acquired from the data, and plays an essential role in data utilization.

However, to reuse this data for new experiments, decision-making processes, and integrate these data with other long-term initiatives, scientists need more information related to data creation and its evolution, intellectual property rights, and technical information in order to evaluate the use of this data. Provenance metadata emerges as a way to evaluate the quality and reliability of data, audit processes and the data versioning, while enabling the data reuse and the reproducibility of experiments and analysis. However, most solutions for the capture and management of provenance metadata are based on specific tools, restricted scopes, and they are difficult to apply in distributed and heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we present an approach for capturing, managing, and publishing the provenance metadata generated in the environmental monitoring processes. Our computational architecture comprises three main components: (1) a data model based in PROV-DM and Dublin Core, (2) a repository of RDF Graphs, and (3) a Web API that provides services for collecting, storing, and querying provenance metadata. We demonstrate the application of our approach and show its practical usefulness by evaluating this architecture to manage provenance metadata generated during an environmental monitoring simulation. The results show that our approach is effective in collecting and storing provenance metadata and allows the query of an entire provenance of datasets and data products, thus enabling reuse, discovery, and visualization of raw data, processes, and scientists involved in its generation and evolution.","2155-6814","978-1-5090-2833-7","10.1109/MASS.2016.050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815044","Data Provenance;Environmental Monitoring;Internet of Things;Computational Architecture","Metadata;Resource description framework;Environmental monitoring;Computer architecture;Software algorithms","","4","","20","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a SaaS approach to dynamically generate a full set of ASP.net source codes and database schema for web-based questionnaire systems for data analysis in e-Business. The tool we proposed, i-Questionnaire, adopts SaaS for the software delivery model in which software and its associated data are hosted centrally and accessed by users using a thin client. The tool i-Questionnaire provides the template selections for designers to choose and construct the questionnaires they prefer. The generated ASP.net source codes can be presented in the form of the questionnaires shown on the mobile or web-based platforms via internet. The results of the answers are stored in repository for data analysis and data mining. It also provides the table schema definition for any relational database server in a cloud computing environment. In addition, the generated source codes present the result data on-line in graphical presentation in a technical and professional way. In this paper, four major components are identified in the SaaS framework, which have been fully implemented with the C++ language in our prototyping.

OuterSPACE is a highly-scalable, energy-efficient, reconfigurable design, consisting of massively parallel Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD)-style processing units, distributed memories, high-speed crossbars and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). We identify redundant memory accesses to non-zeros as a key bottleneck in traditional sparse matrix-matrix multiplication algorithms. To ameliorate this, we implement an outer product based matrix multiplication technique that eliminates redundant accesses by decoupling multiplication from accumulation. We demonstrate that traditional architectures, due to limitations in their memory hierarchies and ability to harness parallelism in the algorithm, are unable to take advantage of this reduction without incurring significant overheads. OuterSPACE is designed to specifically overcome these challenges. We simulate the key components of our architecture using gem5 on a diverse set of matrices from the University of Florida's SuiteSparse collection and the Stanford Network Analysis Project and show a mean speedup of 7.9× over Intel Math Kernel Library on a Xeon CPU, 13.0× against cuSPARSE and 14.0× against CUSP when run on an NVIDIA K40 GPU, while achieving an average throughput of 2.9 GFLOPS within a 24 W power budget in an area of 87 mm2.","2378-203X","978-1-5386-3659-6","10.1109/HPCA.2018.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8327050","Sparse matrix processing;Application specific hardware;Parallel computer architecture;Hardware software co design;Hardware accelerators","Sparse matrices;Computer architecture;Kernel;Matrix decomposition;Parallel processing;Graphics processing units;Libraries","","186","","60","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the number of digital twins in a factory increases rapidly, data source integration has to scale well. Until now, little guidance is available on how to implement this integration in a scalable and reusable manner for Industry 4.0. To close this gap, we define five architecture blueprints based on our experience in various Industry 4.0 projects. These blueprints detail various integration scenarios differentiated by key attributes like frequency of data consumption and data production. In these architecture blueprints, two core components, the Updater and the Delegator, are identified. By providing and evaluating our open-source implementation of these two components, we show the feasibility of the defined blueprints.

But still, many parts of the life cycle of a battery system are not under accurate supervision. This paper proposes a digital twin architecture for automotive battery systems, on which digital services for various stakeholders along the manufacturing and product life cycle of a battery system can be established. Those services make use of the digital twin as a backbone, close open gaps and enable novel approaches in manufacturing and product use. The results feature an UML meta model as a first step toward implementing of a digital twin for battery systems. The meta model reflects the proposed architecture and allows domain-specific models to be built. The models in turn can act as blueprint for the implementation of the digital twin paradigm over the whole life cycle.","","978-1-5386-8500-6","10.1109/ICPHYS.2019.8780347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8780347","Battery System;Digital Twin;Architecture;UML Model","Batteries;Unified modeling language;Automobiles;Automotive engineering;Hardware;Computer architecture;Manufacturing","","32","","27","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In view of the sanctions currently imposed on the Russian Federation, it is worth considering mainly open projects and/or domestic developments. We will highlight the main criteria that it is desirable to take into account when designing the architecture of an automated system to support the synthesis of new technical systems and technologies: (a) ability to store and process large amounts of data; (b) unification access for all data analysis procedures; (c) maximum automation of all stages; (d) modularity of the structure, focus on the expansion of functionality; (e) focus on open source solutions and software of domestic manufacturers, excluding rigid binding to paid foreign solutions. As a result of the work done, various aspects of the implementation of the required automated system were analyzed. A review of various software systems and cloud products showed that the concept of building data lakes (Data Lake) in conjunction with the distributed processing tools of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem is used for big data processing. An architecture framework based on a centralized data warehouse and Hadoop components is proposed. It will be possible to increase the functionality of the platform by adding new microservices that connect to the storage and distributed processing tools via the API, as well as using a single web service for managing and displaying data analysis results from these microservices.","","978-1-6654-6429-1","10.1109/SmartIndustryCon57312.2023.10110764","Russian Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10110764","architecture;physical knowledge;information support;search design","Distributed processing;Data analysis;Web services;Architecture;Ecosystems;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture","","2","","20","IEEE","1 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, many enterprises have adopted Business Architecture concepts to structure, define, plan, measure and optimize their operations. Second, enterprises have leveraged the vast wealth of dynamic and unstructured web information to identify competitive advantages, recognize social media sentiment patterns or anomalies, and assuage potentially damaging client perceptions. These tasks are commonly performed independently of each other, thus missing several synergetic opportunities. By establishing a systematic relationship between these seemingly disjoint trends, enterprises and consulting service companies gain competitive, operational advantages, and recurring benefits. This paper describes a systematic approach whereby results from text mining analysis are integrated with the Business Architecture to empower business users to leverage social media data for increased decision making efficiencies. Applying design science, the proposed approach is explained by providing a conceptual model and a two-phased integration method. It is then buttressed by a sample scenario derived from the banking industry. We discuss the potential operational and competitive gains realized by adopting our approach, and the directions for future work.","2166-0786","978-1-61284-415-2","10.1109/SRII.2011.99","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5958123","component;Business Architecture;Text Analytics;Data Mining;Social Media Metrics;Business Metrics","Measurement;Media;Barium;Companies;Context;Monitoring","","","2","22","IEEE","18 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces a new approach to evaluate, at early design phase, the reliability of a computing system running a software. The approach can be used when the hardware architecture is not completely defined yet. In order to be independent of the hardware architecture and at the same time accurate, we propose to use the Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) framework. In addition, to reduce the reliability evaluation time, our approach consists in analyzing the variable lifetimes to compute the probability of masked faults. Finally, to achieve a better characterization we propose to consider also the presence of caches and register files. For this purpose, a cache emulator as well as a register file emulator are developed. Simulations run with our approach produce very similar results to those run with a hardware-based fault injector. This proves the accuracy of our approach to evaluate system reliability with a gain in the simulation time and without requiring a hardware platform.","2375-1053","978-1-4673-8454-4","10.1109/VTS.2016.7477299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477299","Reliability;Hardware Faults;Lifetime;LLVM;Data Cache;RAM","Hardware;Registers;Random access memory;Reliability;Software;Clocks;Computer architecture","","8","","20","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of the software package is to provide an integrated software solution to realistic plant modelling, real-time scene rendering, growth simulation and applications at different scales from individual, stand (population, community) to landscape. Its key components are ParaTree, LSTree, VisForest, and ForestSIMA. The software package is implemented with VC++, OpenGL Graphics standard, while ForestSIMA is also based on ArcGIS ArcObjects developer kit. ParaTree and LSTree are core of OntoPlant. They are used to build individual plant model. ParaTree combines geometric modelling and parameterized modelling. The shape characteristic of tree organ is depicted with a group of parameters, the values of parameters can be edited by interactive graphical parameter curve component tool. This tool provides friendly interface and intuitive interactive means, namely, what you see is what you get. The ParaTree can simulate realistic 3D plants at any age or season by modifying the parameters, pruning the tree. It is adaptive to simulate the architecture of tree. It doesn't require users to have much knowledge of biology. While the opposite is true for LSTree. LSTree is based on the theory of L-systems, which is faithful to the plant morphology and the physiological growth process. This system makes it possible to model the development of plants with efficiency and flexibility as a process of string rewriting. VisForest is a software platform for creating and editing 3D scenes. It allows the fusion of geospatial data (terrain, images) with 3D objects (plants and house) in a georeferenced environment, definition of 3D scene component, distribution density and form of plants. The ForestSIMA is an application designed to assist in landscape level analysis and planning of forest ecosystems by automating the tasks of stand projection, graphical and tabular summarization, stand visualization, and landscape visualization. Its current and potential applications include plant modelling, growth simulation, assisted design and resource management in botany, ecology, applied plant sciences (horticulture, agriculture and forestry), landscape design, entertainment (games, films, and animations), military simulation and education.","","978-1-4244-8351-8","10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5969053","Virtual plants;3D modelling;growth simulation;virtual forest environment;visualization","Biological system modeling;Vegetation;Solid modeling;Three dimensional displays;Software;Data visualization;Mathematical model","","9","","21","IEEE","1 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the increase in the amount of freight as well as stringent emission norms are putting enormous pressure on the fleet operators. Additionally, due to the lack of industry standards the manufacturers are also not committing their fortunes over an evolving technology. Therefore, before we achieve a well-established and standardized methodology for the design of electric drivetrains for logistic vehicles, a sub-optimal, short term and still cost effective solution need to be devised that will serve as a precursor for the future of the industry. In general, electro- mobility is subject to high cost pressure due to the additional costs of the battery. In this case, the reduction of costs of other parts of the drivetrain plays an important role for the viability of this technology. This paper focuses on the identification of the cost- effective drivetrain variant for medium-heavy duty trucks. For this purpose, an appropriate method is required for the cost calculation during the stages of product development and production. Therefore, during this phase of technology evolution of electro-mobility, an innovative manufacturer-oriented cost calculation method is developed, evaluated and used to investigate the research question of which drivetrain variant is the most economical overall, considering the development and production cycle in a given scenario. The market of medium-heavy duty trucks is energy cost driven, but from the manufacturers perspective significant savings can be made by implementing an optimal drivetrain methodology. For this analysis, the suitable drivetrain concepts are compared based on the empirical data obtained from available industry standards. The results are also derived from a research project currently being undertaken at the Institute PEM of RWTH Aachen University and financed by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety.","","978-1-7281-4319-4","10.1109/EDPC48408.2019.9011844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9011844","Medium-heavy duty trucks;design challenges;production costs;electric drivetrain","Wheels;Industries;Electric potential;Batteries;Electric vehicles;Nitrogen","","4","","36","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, existing vehicle intrusion detection models encounter challenges in capturing temporal aspects, compromising the preservation of temporal attributes in the data. Addressing this predicament, we propose a novel Vehicle Intrusion Detection System (PTIDS) model based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Transformer architecture, equipped with multi-type classification decisions. This model utilizes the PCA algorithm to preprocess the data and employs a multi-head self-attention mechanism to simulate the continuous input of the real-world environment in vehicle or track traffic data. Experimental results demonstrate that the PTIDS model outperforms traditional neural networks regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for vehicle intrusion detection, confirming the importance of temporal variables in intrusion detection. However, owing to the high accuracy and low discrimination of the PTIDS model on the Car Hacking dataset, we migrated the model to the M-CAN and B-CAN intrusion datasets and conducted ablation experiments. The results reveal that the model achieved an accuracy of 90.14% on the M-CAN dataset, surpassing other models by 54.5%, demonstrating robust generalization ability.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10447002","Vehicle intrusion detection;Temporal attributes;Transformer;Multi-head Self-attention;Track traffic","Dimensionality reduction;Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Signal processing;Transformers;Data models;Security","","","","21","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we focus on using a variety of data layouts (mixed format) for storing complex numbers at different stages of the computation so as to limit the use of these instructions. Using complex matrix multiplication and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) as our examples, we demonstrate that performance improvements of up to 2× can be attained with mixed format within the computational routines.

In order to achieve these intended outcomes, the adoption of EA by an organisation needs to be embraced throughout the organisation by its employees. Very little has been published about the impact of EA adoption on the employees within an organisation. This paper reports on the research findings of a study that investigated the impact of managerial EA decisions on software developers in a software development company. The study used an ethnographic case study, literature analysis and surveys, and as contributions, identified the impacts, as well as possible solutions to problems experienced by the company's software developers as result of EA adoption by management.

Data leak poses a severe threat to the data security of these organizations. In the private sector, such leakage can damage the reputation of a business and weaken its competitiveness, while a leakage in the government sector can severely impact its public and diplomatic relationships and even threaten national security. Therefore, private and government sectors have recently strived to adopt the Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) program to enhance data security and minimize data leakage. However, some organizations limit their DLP programs to DLP technology implementation. DLP technology represents only a part of the whole process and does not include other essential elements such as planning, policy, process, data ownership and classification, data access control, training, and awareness. A comprehensive adoption of these elements might prevent data leakage. This research paper aims to provide a model for DLP adoption and address the most critical elements of the DLP Adoption Model, which are correlated with the DLP Maturity Level Assessment, the “DLP Maturity Level Grid,” to measure the success of the model.","","978-1-6654-1627-6","10.1109/ISCSIC54682.2021.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644372","Organizational Security;Incident Response;Information Security;Risk Management;Adoption;Data Leakage Prevention;DLP;Detection;Prevention","Training;Computer science;Computational modeling;Data security;Government;Process control;Data models","","2","","14","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data transfer bottleneck becomes a critical impediment, hindering the overall efficiency. To overcome this challenge, a paradigm shift is imperative. Strategies such as in-situ processing and distributed computing models where computation is moved to the data emerge as promising solutions. In the realm of SKA and specifically within SRCNet data processing needs, the conjunction of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) with a decision-making entity driven by Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) becomes pivotal. FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management concerns, enabling the deployment of modular functions in close proximity to data sources. This development aligns with the principle of bringing computation to the data, mitigating the challenges associated with extensive data transfers. The decision-making entity, guided by EAs, facilitates a systematic exploration of near-optimal execution plans, that will provide with detailed information on how and where a function should be executed within the overall computing and data infrastructure. With the focus on two objectives such as execution time and energy consumption, and constraints like data transfers or data locations, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) could be a good option to optimise the movement of the computation to the data. In this context, MOEAs could provide a baseline guide for efficient and cost-effective data processing for the computation model within the SRCNet. Our proposal unifies the technical aspects of FaaS deployment, together with the mathematical modelling and code implementation of a customised first approach MOEA model for the optimisation of function execution plans within the SRCNet architecture and its integration with FaaS.","2473-4691","979-8-3503-6623-5","10.1109/EAIS58494.2024.10570022","Junta de Andalucía; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570022","","Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Decision making;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Data transfer;Data models","","","","15","IEEE","26 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, most of the computer science literature on distributed systems discuss the optimization of algorithms and frequently treat the I/O and input preparation parts of the program execution as a much less important one for overall efficiency. That well-informed decision of ignoring the I/O part when discussing runtime optimization might change to a fault when we consider algorithms running over massive datasets that should also be retrieved at a user's request. In this paper, we propose and analyze an user-centric processing platform for running algorithms over satellite imagery products, including a review of the important challenges, solutions, and opportunities on extracting valuable results from GIS products.

One major challenge is the current existence of two different emerging standards for this domain, AUTOSAR and EAST-ADL2. These potential standards should be borne in mind during the software product line introduction because they may someday become mandatory. In addition, the existing development process should be changed as little as possible, and one final important requirement for the software product line is the implementation of a single point of control to ensure consistency between various development artifacts. To this end, we propose a lightweight introduction of EAST-ADL2 as a documentation tool only as an initial step. This is achieved by extracting structural information from AUTOSAR models and automatically generating the corresponding EAST-ADL2 representation. The automatic generation ensures consistency between AUTOSAR and EAST-ADL2 models. As an important side effect, variability information can be extracted in this transformation step and used to build an EAST-ADL2 compositional variability model. This model can then be mapped to the central domain model and used to configure the EAST-ADL2 documentation to the other development artifacts consistently. In this way, we can accomplish the lightweight introduction of EAST-ADL2 in the development process through the automatic generation and use the generated variability information for configuration from a single control point.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-4525-7","10.1109/HICSS.2012.414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149565","","Software;Unified modeling language;Computer architecture;Automotive engineering;Hardware;Data mining;Sensors","","2","","25","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been highlighted as a priority for policy-makers, and there is an increasing need to understand it from both a practical and theoretical perspective. In a review of the open data literature we focus on the main management challenges and identify a number of ""cross-cutting"" issues: the conflict between protecting and revealing information, the need to reconcile diverse stakeholder perspectives, and the lack of mature processes for data release. In response to the dearth of theoretical analyses in this, we propose a novel approach based on modular systems theory. Drawing on the concept of IP modularity we suggest that open data can be considered as a form of ""information governance modularity"". Given that modular architectures are often defined by the configuration of components into modules, we examine the release of public sector information as a configuration process. Various definitions of configuration are examined, and conflicts between the product management and information systems perspective are critiqued. Three different models for configuration processes in open data are proposed. Opportunities for further research are highlighted in terms of improved understanding of effective management practices, the application of modular design to information governance, and the modeling of configuration processes in the context of open data.","","978-1-4673-7156-8","10.1109/ICE.2015.7438689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438689","configuration;open data;modularity;modular systems;information governance;public sector","Stakeholders;Government;Law;Data models;Economics;Information systems","","1","","75","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apart from improving prediction accuracy over alternative approaches, our approach allows for massive parallelization, which is essential to handle the scale of data processed by business applications today.

In an attempt to conform to the changes to technology with sufficient speed, the DoD has committed to the concepts of modularity and openness in their systems via the Modular Open Systems Architecture (MOSA) initiative. Openness in technology is achieved through widely supported and consensus-based interface standards, facilitating rapid component replacement and shorter acquisition cycles. Such standards codify system interfaces, enabling easier integration of components conforming to the same standard. The U.S. Army's Program Executive Office for Army Aviation (PEO Aviation) has adopted the Open Group Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) as the open software standard for current and future platforms.For Systems being designed from the top-down (systems not yet built) following the FACE Technical Standard for data modeling and interface definition becomes a rote process. However, there is an increasing need to adapt existing systems to the FACE Technical Standard to enable their reuse in future applications. In such cases, the interfaces are already defined, and the system's inputs and outputs are documented in an Interface Control Document (ICD). The question arises: Can an existing system be made FACE conformant? There are many steps for a product to be deemed conformant to the standard such as employing a specific software architecture, and adhering to certain acquisition rules. However, the focus of this paper will be on constructing a FACE data model from the system’s existing interfaces. Once built, the data model can then be used to generate FACE conformant software artifacts.

In this study, we propose a framework for suggesting relevant software design from a local repository based on a target software architecture. Our hypothesis in this study is that relevant architectures hold relevant source codes. The main goal of the framework is to increase the effectiveness of software development by empowering programmers to find and reuse existing designs and their source code which are appropriate for their projects. The framework analyzes and suggests designs that closely match the target architecture using a combination of structural similarity, and semantic analysis approaches. The framework is based on the information extracted from the software design. The extracted information can be real dictionary words or composed words or abbreviated terms. Another challenging task was finding real dictionary words from composed and abbreviated terms. We ranked the architectures by finding the real dictionary words from the terms and assigning scores using spaCy pre-trained model based on how well they matched the information in the current software design. The software design and its source code will be suggested based on the result of the pre-trained model spaCy. Evaluation of our developed framework resulted in approximately 85% accuracy in identifier splitting and 75% accuracy in finding real dictionary words from abbreviated terms by applying edit distance Jaccard coefficient.

We utilize transfer learning technique with full-fine tuning from an existing trained model in order to recognize the entities due to the limitation of labeled data. Since some English terms are expressed in product texts, we used multilingual pretrained models with the Transformer Architecture, i.e. multilingual-BERT-base-cased (mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa-base (XLMR) in our approach. The extracted entities were then mapped into a knowledge graph by adopting Text to Knowledge Graph (T2KG) framework components, i.e. using entity mapping and triple integration. The training data contains 1.500 labeled texts, while the test data contains 216 labeled texts conducted in three versions of data and four scenarios. Our evaluation result showed that the XLMR model performed better than mBERT for entity extraction task with an average F1-score of 0,895.

Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals. Further, Asclepios-like applications are very much needed in most Third world countries, including all countries in Africa, as it can significantly enhance the health, safety and well-being of people.","","978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8101981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101981","Agile information exploitation;Communicable diseases;Shallow text processing;Cloud computing;Metadata generation;Ontology management;Pattern recognition algorithms","Data mining;Infectious diseases;Tools;Computer architecture;Metadata;Ontologies;Cloud computing","","1","","15","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional AMI architecture uses a centralized operation center with a centralized meter data management system (MDMS), which makes this system non-scalable. The system needs to be scalable so that with increased demand, it can be expanded at minimal cost. In this paper, we used two types of scalable distributed communication architectures, as initially proposed by Zhou et al. [1], namely, communication architecture with distributed MDMS and fully distributed communication architecture to minimize the deployment cost. We modified the analysis approach and used MATLAB-based code incorporating a Heuristic algorithm to determine close-to-optimal solutions for optimization problems. The unique feature of our work is the process of calculating accumulated bandwidth distance, in which distances between different components of an AMI were calculated according to the practical grid system layout of a city's infrastructure system. Theoretically developed scalability analysis was performed following [1], and the results were compared with the simulated results to indicate the validity of the asymptotic theoretical analysis. In our simulation, we found that the average distance between MDMS and the operation center was significantly different from that of Zhou et al. [1]. Our simulation results also indicated that both of the proposed architectures were scalable with significantly lower total deployment cost compared to the existing centralized communication architecture.","0840-7789","978-1-4799-3101-9","10.1109/CCECE.2014.6901098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901098","Smart grid;smart meter;scalability;advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);meter data management system (MDMS);optimization;Greedy algorithm;accumulated bandwidth-distance product (ABDP)","Optimization;Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Smart grids;Smart meters;Equations;Scalability","","8","","5","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Purchasing organizations look for better comparability of LCA product data. Policy is about to raise requirements on public claims. Today, disparate standards encourage greenwashing and prevent fair comparison, competition and innovation based on footprint. Therefore, the industry recognizes the need for advancement and harmonization of Life Cycle Assessments. Although a large number of standards and specifications exist, they do not sufficiently address methodological shortcomings for comparability. At the same time various groups and consortia are working on establishing better data collection models for key parts and assemblies of laptops and computers, such as semiconductors and printed circuit boards, but a harmonized approach to leverage the essential aspects of the data models for a broader adoption in the industry is yet missing.

Web usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data obtained from the interactions of the customers with the Web. In this paper, we present a case study of an on-line system that recommends apparels based on a knowledge base that consists of rules gotten from decision tree mining and experienced dressing knowledge. To get these rules, apparel components features such as collar style, number of buttons, slits, kind of fabrics, color and apparel style, etc. that characterize the domain of interest in our case must be extracted at first. Then the components features of apparel products that customers browse or purchase are analyzed and a decision tree model which could infer the customers' ""tastes"" from their personal information could be gotten. Therefore, the system could recommend apparel items catering customers ""tastes"" according the decision tree model. The architecture and general technology of our on-line recommender system are described also. We believe that this approach is relevant to a wider class of e-commerce problems and it can be used in a variety of recommender systems.","","978-1-4244-8438-6","10.1109/WISM.2010.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662281","apparel recommender system;data mining;decision tree;knowledge base;e-commerce","Decision trees;Knowledge based systems;Image color analysis;Recommender systems;Data mining;Feature extraction;Business","","","1","4","IEEE","13 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users’ comments about a product, when positive, bring exceptional opportunity for sellers because it will act as word of mouth (WOM) advertisement and can increase their sales. On the other hand, users trust in WOM because the person who comments is not motivated to benefit from the sales of the products, but sharing experiences about a product with other customers is a motive. Hence WOM helps customers decide better to buy a product, and if it is positive, it can lead to a sale increase. However, the quality of the comments is another essential factor to be considered in e-commerce websites. Because wrong and misleading comments or answers to users’ questions can increase sales at the cost of decreasing user satisfaction. In this study, for the first time, we have proposed a gamification method to increase the effectiveness of WOM by considering the quality of the user comments. To this end, an influence metric was proposed to calculate the products’ ranking in a new fashion. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data from an e-commerce website and compared it with classic product rankings methods. Experimental results show a significant difference between the product ranking using the proposed method compared with the classic product ranking methods, and overall it decreases product rankings.","","978-1-6654-0426-6","10.1109/ICWR51868.2021.9443122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443122","Gamification;Crowdsourcing;Interactive Ranking;E-Commerce;Online Marketing;Influence Metric","Measurement;Crowdsourcing;Mouth","","6","","32","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this concept, the search results are grouped and ranked under facets that guide a user on the dimensions through which the search results can be viewed. It has been implemented on web based query systems by integrating with semantic search engines (like Google, Yahoo and Bing). However, there is a significant opportunity of implementing faceted search in business intelligence (BI) frameworks to include direct searching features through BI dashboards and custom reporting interfaces. In this paper, a technology positioning map for implementing faceted search in BI framework on cloud computing has been presented. BI on the cloud is based on massively parallel processing of hardware and database resources and an XML based service oriented architecture in which the data warehouses and OLAP cubes are formed using XML data files. The architecture has been expanded to include a DOM parser and a DTD mapping system that will parse the 2D XML views (pulled from cubes formed by many-to-many XML files) and extract the database fields to be stored in a facet repository as per pre-established metadata rules. Whenever an OLAP query is invoked by a user (using a decision map), a query coordinator will fetch the relevant 2D OLAP views and group them under facets fetched from the facet repository taking the services of a metadata coordinator. The user can make use of the facets to create direct queries, generate the targeted dashboards, and hence reduce searching time.","","978-0-7695-5046-6","10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682162","Faceted search;Business intelligence;OLAP;XML;data files;XML DOM parsing;XML data warehouse;OLAP cubes;Cloud computing","XML;Bismuth;Databases;Business;Films;Data warehouses;Search problems","","7","","30","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, excessive fluctuations in the price would also bring adverse effects to corresponding industry. The price change of agricultural products was the great event vital to national well-being and the people's livelihood. Since the price of agricultural products was affected by many factors, it was difficult to predict the price of agricultural products timely and accurately. The emergence of cloud computing, accompanied by massive storage space, huge computing capacity and low cost, provided a new direction for data mining to deal with big data. To realize the short-term agricultural product price forecasting, took service oriented forecasting as the guidance, this paper constructed a agricultural product price forecasting service system based on the DOA architecture. The system could conduct the analysis and prediction for the market price through the combined forecasting method of wavelet transform and BP neural network. Based on the 72 sets of monthly price data from January 2013 to December 2018 of the spinach, cabbage, tomato, pepper and potato, this paper studied the changing trend of agricultural products price. Firstly, in this paper, the price was conducted the db5 three scale decomposition using wavelet transform. Then, the shredded trend part and detail part were predicted by BP neural network model respectively. Finally, the prediction results of each component were combined and reconstructed. On the basis of this combined forecasting method, the agricultural product price forecasting service system with functions of price data service and price forecasting service was designed based on DOA architecture. To verify the prediction accuracy to the price of the 5 kinds of vegetables, the prediction accuracy index was used to evaluate and analyze the price prediction results of the system. The results showed that the minimum mean absolute error of the system was 0.083 yuan/kg, the minimum mean percentage error was 3.95%, the minimum mean square error was 0.102 and the agricultural product price forecasting service system combining wavelet transform and BP neural network had better agricultural product price forecasting performance. At the same time, this also meant that the universality of this system could adapt to the price forecasting of a variety of vegetables and provide technical support for producers, operators, consumers and relevant government departments.","2159-6190","978-1-7281-8780-8","10.1109/CLOUD49709.2020.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284302","Cloud computing;Wavelet transform;BP neural network;Agricultural products;Price forecasting service","Wavelet transforms;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Neural networks;Predictive models;Agricultural products;Forecasting","","2","","22","IEEE","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine Learning methods are vital elements of modern cognitive infocommunications systems because they can be used in various ways such as behavior modeling or sentiment analysis. Machine Learning algorithms requires a reliable infrastructure and vast amount of data. Therefore building data warehouse systems is one of the essential steps of of building reliable cognitive infocommunication systems. Finding and preprocessing data streams of different origins are the first steps during the creation of a data warehouse. Unfortunately, online data streams are most often formatted uniquely. Therefore, the obtained data sets must be transformed into a unified data model. The modelling and conversion of data sources serves as a key step during the unification of heterogeneous data. Storage should be persistent, and optimized for the analytical processing of data. These requirements raise technological challenges that are not common during the design of data sources. This paper gives an overview of current data warehouse technologies and suggests an infrastructure implementation. Hive is used for accessing, modifying, and running complex analytics on the stored data sets. Economical data can often be unique to the product, or the industry it covers. Different data sources used unique data formats which were tailored for their application area or needs. Moreover, some of these data sources may change their format in time. Therefore, a flexible data transformation step is required which can be configured easily. The ETL processes of the data sources are implemented in Python, and Hive.

Gebhard","Rolls Royce Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA",2011 Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium,"21 Apr 2011","2011","","","1","6","Rolls-Royce maintains a strong commitment to providing the highest quality gas turbine power system products in the marketplace today. However, given the global pressures to achieve a high level of quality at a low predictable cost of ownership under the new TotalCare®, MissionCare® and CorporateCare® maintenance agreements, Rolls-Royce utilizes reliability improvement programs early in a products life cycle to grow the reliability to maturity in an effort to assure the maintenance agreement costs are set competitively. Maintaining a highly reliable product has not always been the number one priority of some gas turbine engine programs due to the nature of previously negotiated contracts which had different primary objectives in mind. As the legacy contracts slowly begin to phase out, it becomes increasingly important to assess the early reliability of the engine fleet by reviewing component condition data for each engine, collected during the time of each engine shop visit. Evaluating shop visit data to increase the products reliability is an extremely labor intensive and costly process. Until recently the benefits from a data collection effort were thought to be immeasurable. Therefore, allocating the correct type and scale of resources necessary to understand the root cause(s) behind any reliability shortfalls is paramount. Overall, reliability data collection efforts serve more than one purpose to the engine program. Therefore, an optimization tool was developed to assure the correct data collection strategy is adopted. The tool is known as the REliability Data Collection Optimization Tool or REDCOT. The ultimate goal of REDCOT is to correctly recommend to the user which of three different typical data collection strategies available offers the greatest life cycle cost benefit. It is important to note that the output from REDCOT does not provide the user with recommended system architecture, but instead simply aids in steering a programs data collection strategy. Applying REDCOT to define new data collection requirements helps assure resources are not allocated unnecessarily to collect shop visit records which are not needed to help improve product reliability. Case studies demonstrate a recommended range of data collection coverage during the fleets shop visits in order to assure the reliability can be improved by selecting the appropriate root cause to address.","0149-144X","978-1-4244-8856-8","10.1109/RAMS.2011.5754462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5754462","data collection;reliability;Monte Carlo simulation","Reliability;Mathematical model;Power system reliability;Data models;Engines;Optimization;Equations","","1","","2","IEEE","21 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the major concerns that draws the attention of researchers is the exponential growth of the energy consumption and carbon emission of the DCNs. Studies conducted to identify the causes of the increasing energy consumption have proved that the growing size of computing demand, the over-provisioning of the networking resources, the under-utilization of the infrastructure, the fault-tolerance, the high bandwidth exigence and the inefficient hardware and cooling structure are leading to considerable energy waste. Therefore, in recent years, new data center (DC) architectures are proposed where new hardware types and new technologies are implemented for the sake of energy efficiency. Other efforts are focusing on designing algorithms and strategies to enhance the utilization of the network resources. Replacing brown power by renewable energy was also one of the attractive ideas to minimize the energy costs. In this survey paper, we will present energy-related problems in data centers and review the state of the art of the research literature on energy efficient architectures, techniques, technologies, resource management, and thermal control and monitoring. Additionally, we present the challenges facing each approach and the strategies to build a green DC.

A lifecycle toolset is described which fuses systems and software modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities, modular open system architectures (MOSA), and device and sensor integration techniques into a single package to enable rapid design, development, verification, certification, and deployment of interoperable, platform portable, embedded mission-critical safety-critical avionic systems. TES' MBSE lifecycle toolset, AWESUM™, supports system architecture and virtual integration (SAVI) of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets, and evaluation of these platform assets through simulated mission rehearsals in a network-centric collaborative virtual environment. The result is improved systems product. The toolset has been demonstrated to several aviation-focused communities including the American Helicopter Society International (AHS), the Association of Old Crows (AOC), the FACE Consortium, and the US Army's Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), with favorable response. TES demonstrated a virtual simulation of realistically modeled and simulated multiple dissimilar aircraft platform systems conducting network centric operations (NCO). With the goal of improving flight-safety and enhancing the situational awareness (SA) of the battle-space, virtual missions were executed showing the inter-operations of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets and capabilities from reusable FACE-aligned applications. The simulated battle-space was composed of device-configured simulated flight models of both manned and unmanned rotorcraft platforms operating within a virtual environment of real-world terrain data. The environment included simulated threats and obstacles used to stimulate platform devices that report detections and produce alerts for own-ship flight mishap avoidance. These detections were then packaged into communications messages (VMF) and shared off-platform via NCO to the common operating picture (COP) to enhance the SA operations of the battle space flight group. After a decade of development and use supporting US Army military common software programs for the PM-AME and AMRDEC, TES is now making its industry-unique approach and model-based airworthy systems/software lifecycle product line available to industry. The MBSE lifecycle toolset product suite, referred to as AWESUM™ for AirWorthy Engineering Systems Unified Modeling, is a comprehensive model-based environment aligned to DO-178C, DO-331, AC 20-148, AR 7062, and FACE™. The AWESUM™ tool suite is currently supporting the US Army's Joint Common Architecture project, a model-based avionics architecture for the Joint Multi-Role family of future vertical lift platforms, and two other FACE-aligned US Army Aviation programs within the military communications and aircraft survivability domains. This is TES-SAVi's first publication and presentation to the IEEE. While we have applied our capabilities to the Military Aviation domain, these capabilities can be effectively applied to Aerospace and other domains.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-1622-1","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836220","","Atmospheric modeling;Data models;Software;Object oriented modeling;Standards","","5","","22","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Supply chain finance is an important tool to improve supply chain resilience, ease corporate financing constraints, and reduce financial transaction risks. In the context of the digital transformation of the industrial chain, in order to break the development problems such as closure and centralization under the traditional supply chain finance model, the digital supply chain finance platform has been created by using block chain, big data and Internet of things. The platform relies on the reconstruction of the bank's core business system to build a foundation for digital transformation, integrates the business flow, logistics, capital and information flow of the industrial chain at the base and application layer, and improves the supply chain financial product system based on the oil and gas industry, embedding bank financial services into all aspects of the oil and gas industry production and sales. This paper introduces the construction of digital supply chain finance platform. The application for the oil and gas industry shows that under the condition of data sharing and mutual trust, taking the digital supply chain financial service platform as the starting point can improve financing efficiency, reduce financing costs and risks, expand financing capacity, enhance supply chain value and competitiveness, and help the high-quality development of the oil and gas industry","","979-8-3503-7331-8","10.1109/ICCSIE61360.2024.10698449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10698449","finance platform;oil and gas industry;supply chain finance;banking core business system","Costs;Supply chain management;Digital transformation;Supply chains;Finance;Big Data;Gas industry;Petroleum industry;Financial services;Business","","","","7","IEEE","7 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All of these elements can be considered SECO assets and need to be supported via SECO governance since their organization and evolution represent an IT Architecture. So, IT companies or their IT divisions can use the ISO/IEC 19770 standard for Software Asset Management (SAM) in order to control costs and optimize software investments. In this sense, this paper describes a SECO Governance approach for enabling an IT Architecture based on SAM.","2150-4946","978-1-4799-0786-1","10.1109/DEST.2013.6611329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6611329","software ecosystems;governance;software asset management;IT architecture;services;reuse","Software;Companies;Computer architecture;Standards;Ecosystems","","6","","17","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Providers rely immediately on elastic computing to scale-up or -down infrastructure resources based on incoming workloads and user settings. However, elasticity comes at a price, as adding resources may significantly increase energy usages and costs. We believe that, before scaling-up, it is possible to cope with different workloads and energy expenditure by automatically reconfiguring the software architecture of the Cloud. This paper presents a self-adaptive architecture and a set of techniques that use information about energy consumption to enforce policies to reduce cost and energy. We experiment our approach by reconfiguring different HTTP servers and web applications of the back-end servers based on the workload and energy consumption without interrupting current running services. Our approach proves more efficient when compared to elasticity methods under the same workloads.","","978-1-4673-9899-2","10.1109/ICSIIT.2017.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8262555","dynamic software product line;energy aware;virtualized system","Servers;Computer architecture;Load modeling;Runtime;Energy consumption;Cloud computing","","3","","25","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When there are tight constraints on resources such as bandwidth and processor capacity, however, certain seemingly small changes in a few components have the potential to create a cascade of timing problems. The ability to rapidly analyze and quantify the impact of these changes prior to implementation and system integration provides the engineering team with early validation of the changes, which can prevent substantially increased costs for design, integration, and verification, as well as delays in the development schedule. However, detailed early evaluation of architecture performance involves analysis of many complex interrelated variables and is therefore challenging. Consider the case of moving a task from a processor's IMA partition to another processor's partition. The tasks sets need to be updated. The I/O and network traffic must be rerouted. The schedulability equations of processor, I/O and network need to be recreated, and the analysis needs to be propagated end to end. Last but not least, all the architecture specification documents have to be updated. In order to reduce the detailed architecture evaluation effort, we have automated the performance analysis process with a system integration tool prototype called ASIIST (Application-Specific I/O Integration Support Tool). To move a task, we can now use a graphical interface to drag and drop a task from one processor's IMA partition to another. All the steps described above are done automatically, including the updating of the architecture specification in AADL (Architecture Analysis and Description Language). In this paper, we show how to use this tool to explore the design space of an IMA system architecture, so as to derive designs with specified performance properties.","2155-7209","978-1-4244-6618-4","10.1109/DASC.2010.5655464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655464","","Computer architecture;Analytical models;Delay;Hardware;Libraries;Software","","5","","21","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The success of this industry requires continuous development and improvement in the way products are produced and maintained. In order to ensure equipment availability, quality and safety, maintenance has become an important aspect of production support. Improper maintenance and unavailable equipment often limit the effectiveness of manufacturing. About one-third of total maintenance cost is spent unnecessarily because of situations, such as overtime costs, bad planning, misuse of preventive maintenance, and poor usage of work order systems. Hence, maintenance with little corrective maintenance and less preventive maintenance is called good maintenance. There is a need for additional research within the area of implementing condition-based maintenance (CBM). The research purpose of this research project is to investigate how a condition-based maintenance approach can be implemented in an industrial setting, and to develop a method that can assist companies in their implementation efforts using OSA-CBM (Open System Architecture for Condition-Based Maintenance) data model and various middleware technologies. OSA-CBM is a framework for implementing condition-based maintenance systems. Simply put, it describes the information that is moved and how it should be moved. The potential benefits of an OSA-CBM standard include improved ease of upgrading for system components, reduced cost to end-users, more rapid technology development, and a broader supplier community. There are a few issues that need to be considered before implementing CBM, such as the current state of the company interested in implementing CBM technology; current maintenance cost, and whether a CBM approach can be an integral part of achieving the maintenance goals of that company. In CBM, continuous monitoring of components needs to be done by collecting data from sensors. This data passes through many processors containing various algorithms to provide users the diagnostic and prognostic report of each monitored component. OSA-CBM plays a vital role in providing identity to data in the form of metadata. Examples of metadata by OSA-CBM are id, site, time, alert status, algorithm type, name, description and many more. To determine implementation complications, feasibility and advantages, three middleware (RMI-Java, Ice and IceStorm) 1have been used to implement CBM using an OSA-CBM framework. The focus of this paper is to find network architecture suitable for CBM integration in vehicles (e.g., aircraft) that should be able to support interoperability between multiple vendors of CBM components and insertion of new CBM capabilities. To develop network architecture, essential data, such as bandwidth, data rate, throughput, latency and performance in communication network, has been collected and analysed using various enabling technologies (i.e., middleware).","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500821","Distributed systems;IVHM;systems integration;architecture;Condition-Based Maintenance;OSA-CBM;Middleware;network architecture;System integration","Maintenance engineering;Middleware;Data models;Aircraft;Ice;Computer architecture;Standards","","3","","20","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evolution from single-purpose controllers over distributed networks of multi-function ECUs up to centralized software-heavy computing devices has shifted the focus of development environments from hardware-centric testbeds to virtualized x-in-the-loop evaluation facilities enabling opportunities for early prototyping, virtual integration, and continuous engineering of the system components under consideration. However, determining the proper set of tools which support the required test-driven development processes and infrastructure automation is a challenging task, particularly when considering the individual needs of different product lines. This is due to the plethora of available solutions, each usually dedicated to only certain development aspects, which need to be seamlessly integrated to cope with the complexity of nowadays system architectures and volatility of requirements regarding the functionality and quality of the aspired products. In this context, modern product development requires correspondingly flexible evaluation environments with traceability support, where usually downstream testing activities are performed upfront and continuously on an iterative basis. In this paper, we propose a pragmatic approach for establishing such development environments which can be tailored to the constitution of specific corporate product lines by means of tool chain instantiation and integration. This approach is based on a recurrent 3-phase procedure and an object-oriented data model facilitating the management of relevant details and relations in terms of organizational data, use case descriptions, requirement specifications, as well as tool qualifications. The associated process includes the analysis of relevant practices, recommendations for possible improvements, and implementation of proof of concepts which can be built into a continuous engineering pipeline for the sake of complementing a holistic product development lifecycle.","","979-8-3503-0174-8","10.1109/SESoS59159.2023.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190608","Continuous Engineering;Virtual Integration and Testing;Evidence-based SoS Evaluation;XiL Simulation","Pipelines;Systems architecture;Software;Product development;Task analysis;Testing;Automotive engineering","","2","","10","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the limited capacity of aircraft, the problem of cargo offload occurs frequently. Without prior notice, cargoes are delivered in separate flights, which increase handling complexity. On the other hand, due to the short transit time between flights, the shipper at the origin does not have sufficient time to inform the LSPs the details of cargo being loaded before its arrival. This results in a lack of time for LSPs to assign storage location for the arrived cargo at the distribution center (DC). Hence, the order picking process becomes inefficient and time-consuming, which leads to trucks idling in the docking area waiting for the consolidated goods. The problems become more obvious when handling electronic components and high tech products. In this study, a hybrid RFID case-based decision support system, integrating RFID and case-based reasoning technologies, is proposed for handling air cargo storage location assignment operations in distribution centers.

Assistance means, that in the event of a malfunction, the human driver has to take over the driving task manually again. While for most of the existing driver assistant systems this fail over has to take place immediately, even recently launched highly automated driving systems, such as the drive pilot of Mercedes-Benz in 2018, still require the human driver to take over within a couple of seconds in the event of a fault.Therefore, the human driver is used as fall-back for a system up to Level 3 according to the SAE J3016 standard, which is not possible for vehicles where there is no driver anymore. Accordingly, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as described in Level4 and Level5 in the standard need both, high reliability by minimizing the amount of faults and high availability by still being operational, even in the event of a fault.The same requirement is relevant in the avionic industry, and it is solved with a high amount of redundancy of the safety critical systems.

Ultimately, it uses the last layer of BERT to extract text features as vector representations, which, after a linear transformation, output as probability values. The relation with the highest probability is selected as the predicted relation. This method is compared with traditional approaches using P, R, and F1 Score as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms in all three metrics, confirming its viability.","","979-8-3503-8694-3","10.1109/ICECAI62591.2024.10674887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10674887","relation extraction;BERT;deep learning;furniture","Measurement;Industries;Shape;Production;Color;Feature extraction;Vectors","","","","9","IEEE","24 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Objective: We aim at supporting continuous requirements elicitation by combining user feedback and usage monitoring. Online feedback mechanisms enable end-users to remotely communicate problems, experiences, and opinions, while monitoring provides valuable information about runtime events. It is argued that bringing both information sources together can help requirements engineers to understand end-user needs better. Method/Tool: We present FAME, a framework for the combined and simultaneous collection of feedback and monitoring data in web and mobile contexts to support continuous requirements elicitation. In addition to a detailed discussion of our technical solution, we present the first evidence that FAME can be successfully introduced in real-world contexts. Therefore, we deployed FAME in a web application of a German small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) to collect user feedback and usage data.

To achieve this goal, we employed eye-tracking technology, a physiological measurement method, in conjunction with Kansei evaluation, to quantitatively analyze participants' eye-tracking data, Kansei evaluation data, and preferences for different samples. Through the analysis of the experimental results, we found that participants demonstrated a higher level of attention toward the side view of the sports slippers than others. Therefore, the side view can be considered the fundamental perspective for sports slipper research. This finding provides essential guidance for subsequent design and research endeavors. In the study of Kansei evaluation, we utilized factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a semantic differential scale consisting of 10 sets of adjective pairs into visual factor and affective factor. Subsequently, we explored the relationship between these two factors of sports slippers and participants' preferences. The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the visual factor and preferences. Furthermore, we identified a specific subgroup of target samples through cluster analysis. We extracted and applied design elements targeted at this subgroup based on these findings. These research findings hold significant reference value for the design and research of sports slippers and other types of footwear. By understanding participants' eye-tracking metrics and Kansei evaluation results, we can better comprehend consumers' preferences and focal points regarding sports slippers to assist designers and researchers in accurately grasping market demands during product development, thereby providing more attractive and consumer-oriented products.","","979-8-3503-4257-4","10.1109/ICID60307.2023.10396744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10396744","Sports Slipper;Eye Tracking Technology;Kansei evaluation;Design Element Extraction","Visualization;Shape;Gaze tracking;Footwear;Feature extraction;Product design;Sports","","","","6","IEEE","24 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving mechanism that allows ISPs to cooperatively detect anomalies without requiring them to reveal private traffic information. We design a “semi-centralized” architecture and use secure multiparty computation (SMC) protocol to make the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based detection method privacy-preserving and at same time keep its scalability and accuracy. We evaluate our design at a simulated distributed environment by using traffic traces from the Abilene backbone network as well as synthetic traces.

To migrate legacy software into a product line system, it is essential to identify the code segments that should be constructed as features from the source base. However, this could be an error-prone and complicated task, as it involves exploring a complex structure and extracting the relations between different components within a system. And normally, representing structural information of a program in a mathematical way should be a promising direction to investigate. We improve this situation by proposing a probability-based approach named StiCProb to capture source code fragments for feature concerned, which inherently provides a conditional probability to describe the closeness between two programming elements. In the case study, we conduct feature mining on several legacy systems, to compare our approach with other related approaches.

To allow for screening and monitoring and to leave the part unaltered the inspection techniques are required to operate non-destructively. While this allows for full-cover final inspection it also enables repetitive monitoring beneficial for the exploration of material interactions, potential subsequent defect formations and consequently for failure isolation. With increasing complexity inherent in advancing microelectronic technologies, high reliability, robustness and thus, successful failure analysis is essential. The correspondingly shrinking feature sizes and the involvement of heterogeneous materials highly challenge existing techniques. Furthermore, the interpretation of the acquired data becomes increasingly difficult requiring specifically skilled operating personal. In previous studies machine learning (ML) approaches have been developed and evaluated for their ability to analyze signals acquired by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) with the goal of automated defect detection, characterization, and failure isolation. The present paper investigates different ML architectures to analyze the time signals after transformation into the spectral- and wavelet domains. Results showed that 2D CNNs analyzing the acquired acoustic signals in the wavelet domain representation performed best, however at the expense of additional computational effort. Furthermore, ML-based analysis was explored for its potential to locate and isolate electrically active defects in the depth-dimension based on thermal emissions using lock-in thermography (LIT). Obtained LIT-related results are promising, however require further research to fully enfold its potential. It was further found that transfer properties of the inspection tools interfere with the defect specific signal features and thus so far tie the trained models to the specific equipment used. Future work should therefore focus on removing the specific tool related transfer characteristics of the equipment from the measurement data to allow for intra-tool compatibility and thus a more generalized application.

Standard telecom undersea amplifiers offer the potential for tremendous capacity, but in some cases may not be optimal for low data rate or small capacity ocean observatory needs. Amplifier designs can be tailored for specific capacity requirements and can be further customized to support transmission using other-than-telecom-grade terminal transceivers. As a clear channel device, an EDFA can support a wide variety of data formats and bit rates. Multiple amplifier designs can operate simultaneously in the same repeater housing using the same single line-current feed. Optical add-drop multiplexing can be implemented to further enhance the flexibility and bandwidth utilization in these applications. A deep understanding of transmission design, simulation, and modeling can be leveraged to optimize the amplifier design and transmission performance for each specific ocean observatory need. Cabled ocean observatories typically use permanently-powered fiber-optic undersea cables for the transmission of data and electrical power. The undersea telecom industry has off-the-shelf products available and qualified for deepwater use that can be combined to support ocean observatory applications with unique powering and transmission requirements, including functions demanding much higher power than basic, low data rate sensor functions. This paper will review the basics of repeatered and nonrepeatered undersea fiber-optic transmission systems and provide summary descriptions of a number of qualified fiberoptic products relevant to cabled ocean observatories.

The combined use of such procedures generates information that contributes to the understanding of what elements are essential for the consumer perception about the product benefits. This information is important to guide the buy-collaborate-make decision in the acquisition stage of Technology Management concerning the product-system life-cycle.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-27-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641823","","Green products;Loading;Technology management;Cleaning;Companies;Market research","","1","","33","","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We started from a few critical user scenarios and their associated quality attribute scenarios, which makes these models lightweight and concise, expressing high-level abstractions only. We also separated static views from dynamic views so that each diagram can be precise and suitable for analyzing different types of quality attributes respectively. The combination of scenarios, quality attributes, and lightweight modeling was well accepted by the team as an effective way to analyze and communicate the trade-offs. A few days after we presented and shared this process, two new projects within the Monarch team adopted component and sequence diagrams in their design documents, and two other product areas within Google started to learn and to adopt the process as well.

"Behavioral Circuit Models of Data Clocked and Reference Clock Driven Retimers for Signal Integrity Transient Simulation","Z. Chen","IBM Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY",2016 IEEE 66th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC),"18 Aug 2016","2016","","","997","1004","Two different behavioral circuit models are proposed in this paper, one for the data clocked retimer and the other for the reference clock driven retimer. Instead of two or more piping simulations, the proposed retimer behavioral models can be used in any general purpose transient simulation tools by a single transient simulation. The proposed retimer behavioral circuit models are in a sub-circuit form and can be used directly and independently. The retimer behavioral circuit models include several new building block models such as a behavioral circuit model of signal rise-fall edge trigged latch, a behavioral circuit model of the reference clock driven latch, a behavioral circuit model of the CDR based on the jitter transfer function of the applied clock architecture, a behavioral circuit model of the lossy clock channel, and a behavioral circuit model of the clock frequency N-multiplier. The proposed retimer models also include some existing models such as a behavioral circuit models of a time-domain jitter to data stream modulator, a bidirectional single-ended-mode to mixed-mode transformer, and behavioral circuit models for CTLE, DEF, and pre-emphasis Tx. To include the low frequency periodic jitter, a time-frequency scaling method is proposed to use a much shorter circuit time for affordable signal integrity transient simulations. The transient circuit simulation for eye-diagram by using the proposed retimer behavioral circuit models can include the periodic, ISI induced, and crosstalk induced jitters in signal and/or clock channels. The proposed retimer behavioral circuit models are tested in transient circuit simulation on packaging systems including active twinaxes and on printed circuit board wires. No convergence problem appears during the test simulations. The simulation results look reasonable and have been verified by different methods.","","978-1-5090-1204-6","10.1109/ECTC.2016.36","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7545548","signal integrity;behavioral model;high speed system;jitter;retimer;twinax;reference clock;CDR;frequency N-muliplier","Integrated circuit modeling;Jitter;Clocks;Data models;Latches;Transient analysis;Transfer functions","","2","","14","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ViT deployment on micro-controller units (MCUs) has high expectations; however, it is a hardness challenge due to the computation cost for ViT. This paper provides a ViT implementation analysis on a small RISC-V processor for efficiency deployments and acceleration. Specif-ically, we target a CV32E40p, a 4-stage in-order 32-bit RISC- V processor core well-known for low-power and small-area. The analysis is performed from the perspective of hardware features (e.g., clock cycles, IPC, the data hazards) for the ViT components, i.e., the Patch embedding, the Layer Normalization, the Attention, and the Fully-Connected Layer.

This exceptional expansion, combined with dynamic interactions with users and providers, is boosting the development of new electronic business models, such as block chain, fintech, bitcoin, Uber, Airbnb, etc. The information systems that support such business processes, usually depend on distributed database systems. These approaches have mostly opted to exploit two important characteristics of this kind of applications: at first, they contain a set of commodity types with a limited inventory. On the other hand, incremental updates are the kind of operations which these items typically involve. In this sense, it is possible to achieve system distribution by using tokens which represent the commodities? instances for sales in e-business. There exist two mainly different mechanisms for distributing tokens: replication and partitioning. Token replication mechanism demands expensive synchronization protocols to provide the consistency of the data. On the other hand, token partitioning, depends on token redistribution strategies which allow dynamic migration of tokens to those servers in which it is needed. Such strategies are developed from the standpoint that the total system can locally be known, and therefore, they fail to address the important problem of how to allocate and coordinate the data to make it adaptive to rapidly changing situations. In this paper, we present Autonomous Decentralized Database System (ADDS) concept and architecture in order to extend the properties of autonomy and decentralization to wide-area distributed database systems. ADDS fundamental technologies confers autonomy and loosely coupling to all the components of the system (databases) and provides a background coordination to adapt the system to evolving situations. Moreover, we present two data allocation and coordination technologies for high response time based on specific situations. Finally, in order to show the effectiveness of our proposal we compare it with conventional partitioning strategies.","2640-7485","978-1-7281-1672-3","10.1109/ISADS45777.2019.9155574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155574","Autonomous Decentralized Systems;high assurance;distributed databases;data consistency;coordination;mobile agent","Servers;Database systems;Internet;Business;Synchronization;Protocols","","","","11","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to address these issues, recent years have witnessed increasing interest at exploring static sparsity (synaptic memory storage) and dynamic sparsity (neural activation using spikes) in neural networks in order to reduce the necessary computational resources and enable low-power event-driven network operation. Parallely, there have been efforts to realize in-memory computing circuit primitives using emerging device technologies to alleviate the memory bandwidth limitations present in CMOS based neuromorphic computing platforms. In this paper, we discuss these two parallel research thrusts and explore the manner in-which synergistic hardware-algorithm co-design in neuromorphic computing across the stack (from devices and circuits to architectural frameworks) can result in orders of magnitude efficiency compared to state-of-the-art CMOS implementations.","2374-7390","978-1-5386-6318-9","10.1109/SiPS.2018.8598419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598419","Neuromorphic Computing;Sparsity;Spiking Neural Networks;Spintronics;Crossbar Architectures","Neurons;Computer architecture;Magnetic tunneling;Neuromorphics;Synapses;Biological neural networks;Spintronics","","5","","32","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the development of a feature model for mobile and context-aware SPLs is not trivial, since it should comprise system and context information. Furthermore, the consistency check of feature models in the considered domain is also complex and demands advanced skills of software engineers.

These goals translate into on-board processing throughput requirements that are on the order of 100–1,000x more than those of previous Earth Science missions for standard processing, compression, storage, and downhnk operations. To study possible future architectures to achieve these performance requirements, the SpaceCubeX project provides an evolvable testbed and framework that enables a focused design space exploration of candidate hybrid CPU/FPGA/DSP processing architectures. The framework includes ArchGen, an architecture generator tool populated with candidate architecture components, performance models, and IP cores, that allows an end user to specify the type, number, and connectivity of a hybrid architecture. The framework requires minimal extensions to integrate new processors, such as the anticipated High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC), reducing time to initiate benchmarking by months. To evaluate the framework, we leverage a wide suite of high performance embedded computing benchmarks and Earth science scenarios to ensure robust architecture characterization. We report on our projects Year 1 efforts and demonstrate the capabihties across four simulation testbed models, a baseline SpaceCube 2.0 system, a dual ARM A9 processor system, a hybrid quad ARM A53 and FPGA system, and a hybrid quad ARM A53 and DSP system.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943876","","Computer architecture;Program processors;Geoscience;Climate change;Aerospace electronics;Field programmable gate arrays;Benchmark testing","","11","","14","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By exploiting user-level queuing, workload dispatching to specialized hardware accelerators allows the removal of drawbacks present when copying objects through using the operating system calls. Additionally, dispatching is structured to enable fixed-size packet management that hardware specialized logic accelerates. To also eliminate IOMMU performance loss and IOMMU management complexity, we propose direct accelerator data placement in contiguous space in system-memory, where, the dispatcher provides trasparent access to the accelerators and at the same time offers an easy abstraction in the programming layer for the application. We demonstrate dispatching rates that exceed ten thousand jobs per second implementing architectural support on a low-cost embedded System-on-Chip, bounded only by the computing capacity of the hardware accelerators.","1550-6533","978-1-5386-7769-8","10.1109/CAHPC.2018.8645945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8645945","","Hardware;Kernel;Graphics processing units;Dispatching;Computer architecture;System-on-chip;Runtime","","3","1","32","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is pivotal in this regard, offering an exhaustive inventory of components and dependencies crucial to software development. However, prevalent challenges in SBOM sharing, such as data tampering risks and vendors’ reluctance to fully disclose sensitive information, significantly hinder its effective implementation. These challenges pose a notable threat to the security of critical infrastructure and systems where transparency and trust are paramount, underscoring the need for a more secure and flexible mechanism for SBOM sharing. To bridge the gap, this study introduces a blockchain-empowered architecture for SBOM sharing, leveraging verifiable credentials to allow for selective disclosure. This strategy not only heightens security but also offers flexibility. Furthermore, this paper broadens the remit of SBOM to encompass AI systems, thereby coining the term AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). The advent of AI and its application in critical infrastructure necessitates a nuanced understanding of AI software components, including their origins and interdependencies. The evaluation of our solution indicates the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed SBOM sharing mechanism, positing a solution for safeguarding (AI) software supply chains, which is essential for the resilience and reliability of modern critical infrastructure systems.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Software architectures.","","979-8-4007-0565-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10649704","software bill of materials;verifiable credential;selective disclosure","Conferences;Supply chains;Bills of materials;Computer architecture;Software;Critical infrastructure;Blockchains","","","","25","","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, external inflows contaminate the lyophilization chamber and may cause the disposal of the current production batch. Given that a single batch often comprises thousands of product vials, leakages from freeze-dryers pose significant challenges throughout the production chain of lyophilized drugs. Early detection of leakages is critical to optimise the drug production process.

In order to manage the impact of adverse weather effects short time forecasting is employed, since it can be highly accurate to predict a short time, e.g., hours, into the future. In this work, we tackle the challenge of short time weather forecasting using a novel approach based on a modified UNet based model. Specifically, all convolution-based building blocks were replaced by 3D shifted window transformers in both encoder and decoder branches. Shifted window transformers greatly reduce computational complexity requirements, a major constraint of self-attention, without sacrificing performance. To support the pre-training of the transformer-based model a carefully crafted augmentation scheme was proposed. The model was tested on the IEEE Big Data Weather4cast Competition data, which requires the prediction of 8 hours ahead frames (4 per hour) from an hourly weather product sequence. We show the importance of including other weather products in encouraging spatial generalization, while this may not be optimal for temporal generalization. The model demonstrates highly competitive performance on both the validation and test datasets.

"Explainable Anomaly and Intrusion Detection Intelligence for Platform Information Technology Using Dimensionality Reduction and Ensemble Learning","B.

An IDS utilizes machine learning techniques to monitor cyber health, learn from malicious versus normal types of traffic, and implement automated protection measures for PIT systems. Ensemble learning is used for anomaly detection, malware detection, intrusion detection, and subtle or substantial changes in hardware or software. Ensemble learning can be used to differentiate static and dynamic commands, directives, and processes that are normal or abnormal by clustering similarities. This method assists with identification of abnormalities and grouping them. Dimensionality reduction minimizes the number of features currently being evaluated for selection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to highlight the feature that is atypical in the test systems hardware and software baseline. These methods can be used for predictive and cyber health monitoring. Anomaly detection, identification, and discovery of PIT software resources, commands, and directives that have malicious intent. Ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction provide the foundation for an adaptable IDS that changes based on known (supervised) and unknown (unsupervised) environments, processes, programs, data, labels, and traffic. This paper proposes PCA, ICA, and ensemble learning methods for systematic use with PIT systems anomaly and intrusion detection intelligence. The trained IDS and cyber health model provides a software baseline for similar PIT systems. The IDS and preventative cyber health monitoring will be agnostic of the PIT system focusing on automatic test technology. Training the IDS and cyber health monitoring software on multiple PIT systems will provide research, data, and information that can be applied to these unique systems. The blending of normal and malicious behavior, processes, resources, and traffic provides information and data for changes in a PIT systems baseline configuration for even subtle deviations or changes in a systems hardware, software, or firmware. The continuous training, learning, and testing of the common agnostic intelligent anomaly detection and prevention tools provide system readiness to automatic test technology, cybersecurity health monitoring, and thorough detection of the slightest changes in normal system behavior. The application is expanded to include types of artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, policy iteration, and value iteration in the future to advance the research and products for PIT systems.","1558-4550","978-1-7281-2832-0","10.1109/AUTOTESTCON43700.2019.8961052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961052","Intrusion Detection System (IDS);Platform Information Technology (PIT);Ensemble Learning;Principal Component Analysis (PCA);Independent Component Analysis (ICA);Cyber Health Monitoring;Anomaly Detection;Artificial Neural Networks (ANN);Reinforcement Learning","","","5","","15","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, it is used in LINPACK to benchmark the performance of modern multi-core processor environments. These processors offer a large memory hierarchy including multiple registers and various levels of cache. Registers or L1 data cache are small in size but also very fast. The L2 or L3 cache memory is usually shared among other cores and larger but slower. For the LU decomposition, the latency of fetching data from the main memory to the registers to perform a calculation also depends on the input matrix's memory access pattern. Here, we look at the block factorization algorithm, where the LU decomposition performance depends on the performance of the matrix multiplication. In both cases, the LU decomposition and the matrix multiplication, such a matrix is traversed by three nested loops. In this paper, we propose to traverse such loops in an order defined by a space-filling curve. This traversal dramatically improves data locality and offers effective exploitation of the memory hierarchy. Besides the canonical (or line-by-line) access pattern, we demonstrate the traversal in Hilbert-, Peano and Morton order. Our extensive experiments show that the Morton order (or Z -order) and the inverse Morton order (or И-order) have a better runtime performance compared to the others.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378385","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378385","cache-oblivious;space-filling curve;LU decomposition;matrix-mulitplication","Runtime;Program processors;Multicore processing;Linear algebra;Big Data;Registers;Matrix decomposition","","1","","36","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the use of crossbar memory as an analog dot-product engine is well known, no prior work has designed or characterized a full-fledged accelerator based on crossbars. In particular, our work makes the following contributions: (i) We design a pipelined architecture, with some crossbars dedicated for each neural network layer, and eDRAM buffers that aggregate data between pipeline stages. (ii) We define new data encoding techniques that are amenable to analog computations and that can reduce the high overheads of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). (iii) We define the many supporting digital components required in an analog CNN accelerator and carry out a design space exploration to identify the best balance of memristor storage/compute, ADCs, and eDRAM storage on a chip. On a suite of CNN and DNN workloads, the proposed ISAAC architecture yields improvements of 14.8×, 5.5×, and 7.5× in throughput, energy, and computational density (respectively), relative to the state-of-the-art DaDianNao architecture.","1063-6897","978-1-4673-8947-1","10.1109/ISCA.2016.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551379","CNN;DNN;memristor;analog;neural;accelerator","Neurons;Computer architecture;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Memristors;Pipelines;Biological neural networks","","425","43","80","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All these primitives give alternative approaches for FPGA based system design. This paper presents a way to use the Look-up tables to design three bit (3×3) constant coefficient unsigned integral multiplier for Short Word Length DSP systems.

In this paper we present the analyses we have been doing to minimise the cost, the R&D topics we derived from that and how we combined all this into a coherent proposal which allows us to come up with a system which not only today fits the budgetary constraints of LHCb, but also will allow profiting from any main-stream technological development. We achieve this by aligning our system needs as much as possible to data-centre mass-market commercial of the shelf (COTS) products; by minimising the number of optical interconnects and by optimising the physical layout of the system. This system requires only one piece of custom-made hardware, and even this could, for a smaller setup be replaced by a commercially available item.

This has led to redundancy in resource usage in specific use cases, resulting in increased production costs and manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) markups for the finalized products. The average retail price of a new vehicle in the United States increased by 13.4% between 2015 and 2020. Considering the global chip shortage of 2020 and current global inflation, the average price of a new vehicle in the United States reached $49,500 in 2023 [1].

This overlooks the opportunity to better combine point interactions and dimensions by exploiting varying geometry/density of 3D point clouds. In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations. The enlarged search space with heterogeneous search components calls for a better ranking of candidate models. To achieve this, we improve the search space exploration by leveraging predictor-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and enhance the quality of prediction by assigning unique encoding to heterogeneous search components based on their priors.

Specifically, we first present a novel data request and sharing architecture in VEC environments, which utilizes consortium block-chain and smart contracts technologies to achieve secure high-quality data sharing among vehicles. Further, we propose a reputation management scheme based on trust chain and weighted recommended opinion for subjective logic reputation management (TCWRSL), which comprehensively considers the vehicular reputation, time decay effect of reputation and interaction reputation to establish the weight of the trust chain. On this basis, it assists the data requestor to refer to the recommended opinions to calibrate the local opinion. Moreover, we propose the weighted recommended opinion which helps to reduce the destructive impact of malicious vehicles that participate in the recommended opinions. Simulation results based on real data sets demonstrate the superiority of TCWRSL for obtaining more credible vehicular reputation.","","978-1-6654-1461-6","10.1109/ISPCE-CN51288.2020.9321862","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321862","Block-Chain;data sharing;reputation management;vehicular edge computing","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Indexes;Computational modeling;Edge computing;Uncertainty;Reliability","","2","","18","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce the Digital Shadow for Production Quality Analysis (DS-PQA) method and system design that integrates feedback from machine components on the shop floor. To this end, the method leverages FMEA and production system engineering models to configure OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA)-based data acquisition. Based on that data acquisition, the DS-PQA system analyzes data from the shop floor to (i) inform operators on likely causes of a production defect, and (ii) alert FMEA experts about FMEA causes that occur more frequently than expected and should be re-validated. In a feasibility study, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of the DS-PQA method and system on a welding cell that manufactures automotive parts. The study results indicate that the DS-PQA method and system are feasible, more efficient, and can substantially lower the latency for analyzing production quality risk compared to a traditional approach.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921582","Production Systems Engineering;Industry 4.0 component;process FMEA;PPR;Digitalization","Machine components;Production systems;Welding;Microprocessors;Data acquisition;Computer architecture;System analysis and design","","3","","24","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is convenient for users to access their VD on any type of clients (physical terminals) rather than to use the constant terminals. VD have more excellent performance in operation with the SPICE protocol which is a special architecture aimed to virtual machines. Universal Serial Bus (USB) device is a kind of most common devices for computers. To ensure the normal operation of USB devices, USB redirection tools are needed by VD and clients. Existing researches mainly focus on the availability and convenience of USB redirection without considering the safety hazard. It is dangerous for VD to allow all the USB devices redirected automatically as most approaches do. To solve these problems we propose a USB redirection filter named Whitelist method of USB devices, which is called WMUD for short. It provides the control with the USB redirection. The WMUD has been implemented in virtualization based on QEMU and SPICE. We do a demonstration through making WMUD for VD. The effectiveness of WMUD has been proved by some experiments. The results show that WMUD control successfully whether the USB devices can be redirected or not automatically. At the same time, the different VD connect with different USB devices based on their unique filter rules. In addition, we confirm that by using the WMUD, the illegal USB devices are denied to redirect into VD even though attackers set the configuration in clients.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855632","virtual desktop, USB devices control, virtualization security, redirection filter","Universal Serial Bus;SPICE;Protocols;Security;Servers;Whitelists;Virtual machining","","3","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lately, Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) have started to rethink the status quo and to explore new technology driven concepts, such as Remotely operated Towers (RT), which concentrate ATC services for multiple airports at a single central location. Safety and security requirements intrinsic to RT deployments present ideal environments for an adaptive Multiple Independent Levels of Security/Safety (MILS) architecture due to the need to - securely and timely - share information between separate domains across networks. This paper introduces a MILS based architecture to implement a Remote Tower reference system. Basically, this requires an air picture (Radar) and optical sensors (cameras), providing a high-quality real-time image of the runway, the airport ramp and the very nearby airspace (data domain). Beside the live video feed from the airport, air traffic management information (data domain) and voice communication systems (voice domain) are necessary to operate a tower remotely. To be resilient, an RT system must be adaptable such that it can be dynamically reconfigured at runtime without compromising the robustness and integrity of the system. This paper focuses on an adaptive MILS architecture that extends MILS with adaptation mechanisms and a framework within which those mechanisms may be safely and securely employed for reconfiguration within the constraints of a configuration policy. We explain how an integrated RT controller working position implements a MILS console to interact with different isolated domains for operation purposes and, in addition, shares specific platform interfaces for system adaption and monitoring. Finally, the paper introduces the complete work flow starting with the initial SLIMIAADL model, system configuration, operation and adaptation. Suggestions to evaluate overall performance and a discussion of the technical challenges arising from the use of an adaptive MILS approach in a safety-critical environment concludes the contribution.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081732","remote tower;safety and security;MILS;reconfiguration;adaptive systems;model-based systems engineering","","","","","14","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such systems demand a high level of reliability and performance. These systems also have severe cost constraints so including redundant components in the end product is not a viable solution for improving reliability and performance. Another solution is to continuously monitor the system and introduce fault diagnosis to ensure that the dependability of the system is greater than the dependability of its constituent hardware and software components. Active diagnosis is one such technique that improves the reliability of the system by diagnosing facts at run-time for fault isolation and error recovery. The presented work addresses an active diagnosis scenario that uses diagnostic queries and a real-time database to find faults within a distributed system that has limited resources and strict deadlines. Since scheduling the diagnostic tasks is an important aspect of a timely analysis of the system, a list schedule has been proposed that calculates the points in time when the diagnostic queries are executed and data is replicated to the database. This a priori knowledge about the behavior of the query executions will bound the time required for inferring faults that will lead to a realizable diagnostic framework. The proposed algorithm utilizes a priority scheme to schedule the diagnostic tasks onto free processors within minimum time while respecting their precedence and periodicity constraints. The paper presents the approach in detail with the help of examples and results with different design constraints.","1946-0759","978-1-5090-6505-9","10.1109/ETFA.2017.8247610","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247610","distributed fault analysis;diagnosis;active diagnosis;real-time;distributed systems;list scheduling;time-triggered","Real-time systems;Program processors;Sensors;Fault diagnosis;Schedules","","5","","33","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real-time applications, this can result in the overall computation failing to make a deadline. In our work we begin by creating a testbed for low-latency MLP inference, which we then use to explore the application-aware optimization space for compute-bound MLP inference engines. The optimization process begins by identifying modules in the critical path and their connectivity. We then use this information to determine key parameters and their ideal values. In addition, we automate hardware generation using OpenCL to ensure standard optimizations are applied. We find that correct parameter sizing can reduce latency by 20% on average. For the MNIST, Poker, and ECP-Candle benchmarks, we implement inference models using the Arria10X115 FPGA and achieve an average speedup of 1.47x over the NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU.","2377-6943","978-1-5386-5989-2","10.1109/HPEC.2018.8547521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8547521","Neural Network;Multi Layer Perceptron;Inference;FPGA;OpenCL","Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Optimization;Computational modeling;Random access memory;Real-time systems;Neurons","","2","","27","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The three most significant system requirements contributing to that challenge are the scalability of the system, accommodation of heterogeneous digital holdings, and the evolvability of both the constituting technologies and the data formats in storage. The amount of digital-born materials requiring long-term preservation and access is overwhelming due to the fast pace of information technology and its widespread utilization in government, business corporations, academic institutions, and the general public. Compounding to the data volume challenge is the heterogeneity of the data, which range from the products of office automation and geospatial images, to multimedia artifacts. Storing and preserving digital objects must be accomplished in a way that allows access to the objects independently of the platform technology and software applications used to create these objects. As the technologies change rapidly, the LDPAS must accommodate the changes to its benefit, while also increasing in scale. A successful LDPAS must be able to adapt to the two-fold evolutionary demands. The evolution of the system software with time is the norm in any large-scale long-term system. But, even more important is the system's capability to cope with the evolution of the very software applications that generated the digital objects archived within it. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a system of Content Servers, which can scale with the data volume growth, continually sustain evolution in the face of technological change, and provide different levels of service to the different kinds of users accessing the LDPAS. We describe the concept, components and services of a Content Server in the context of digital archiving, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) reference model. Several possible deployment configurations are shown to illustrate the efficient utilization of low level services and the flexibility of the system to scale up or down.","","978-1-4244-5884-4","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482447","Electronic Records;Digital Archives;digital preservation;SOA;OAIS;evolvability;Content Server","Log-periodic dipole antennas;Large-scale systems;Application software;Service oriented architecture;Scalability;Information technology;Government;Office automation;Multimedia systems;System software","","5","","20","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Efficiency, effectiveness and resilence of relevant methods are therefore the main focus. In this paper, a novel Behaviour Trace-based Unsupervised Deep Embedding (BTUDE) architecture has been developed for online recommendation of multiple products in the mobile bank application of a large commercial bank in China (LCB). BTUDE is implemented with a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model in which a ResNet1D network and its reverse implementation, modified for 1D time series processing, play the role of encoder and decoder, respectively. In this architecture, Customer behaviour data grouped in many time series are first processed with a novel normalization method, and then fed into the VAE model. As a quantitative form of the customer profile system, BTUDE represented as the latent space embedding generated by VAE is built up independent of scenarios for any specific product recommendation. In recommendation events for each specific product, BTUDE similarity between potential customers and those already possessed the product can be used as the feature to further detect target customers via a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Different types of tests have been carried out. Online A/B tests have been conducted for a money market fund product. Performance for wealth management and life insurance products are also evaluated. The promising results show that BTUDE is effectively adapted to online environment for recommendation shifting among multiple products in a fast pace.","2832-1871","979-8-3503-3905-5","10.1109/ICCSSE59359.2023.10245940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10245940","VAE;unsupervised learning;customer profile;deep generative model;embedding;recommender systems","Time series analysis;Insurance;Feature extraction;Control systems;Data models;Decoding;Customer profiles","","","","19","IEEE","20 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall SOC performance depends on the numerous design and architectural parameters(frequency, cores, etc.) of the heterogeneous components integrated into the design. This leads to the necessity for performance estimation based validation of the SOC under different design and configuration parameters. Existing traditional standard methods incorporate time-consuming and non-exhaustive cycle-level simulations, which are slow and lead to incompleteness in achieving performance targets at pre-silicon level. The proposed novel AI based performance estimation based technique is used to obtain fast and accurate performance estimates for a complex SOC, which explores the design under multiple configurations without running simulation test content and aids in evaluating design Hardware (HW) bottlenecks and enhancing debug capabilities.","","978-1-6654-9552-3","10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718369","Heterogeneous components;SOC;Design exploration;Stock Keeping Unit (SKU);Regression test suite;Latency;Bandwidth (BW)","Graphics;Portable computers;Estimation;Very large scale integration;Hardware;System-on-chip;Servers","","","","16","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A dynamic resource assignment, however, is quite challenging especially for non-linear analog radio transmitters, like wireless microphones with their challenging requirements regarding data loss and delay. In this paper, we motivate the future need of a dynamic frequency allocation process for PMSE systems that recognizes internal and external constraints, such as intermodulation products or emerging interference from other systems in the radio spectrum. We present a Cognitive Engine architecture, that considers these constraints and evaluate its performance for a selected interference scenario.

Meshes are both a powerful representation for geometrical objects, and a challenge for network architectures because of their inherent irregular structure. This work contributes to adapt classical deep learning paradigms to this particular type of data in three ways. First, we introduce the current-splatting layer which embeds meshes in a metric space, allowing the downstream network to process them without any assumption on their topology: they may be composed of varied numbers of elements or connected components, contain holes, or bear high levels of geometrical noise. Second, we adapt to meshes the exponentiation layer which, from an upstream image array, generates shapes with a diffeomorphic control over their topology. Third, we take advantage of those layers to devise a variational auto-encoding architecture, which we interpret as a generative statistical model that learns adapted low-dimensional representations for mesh data sets. An explicit norm-control layer ensures the correspondence between the latent-space Euclidean metric and the shape-space log-Euclidean one. We illustrate this method on simulated and real data sets, and show the practical relevance of the learned representation for visualization, classification and mesh synthesis.","2473-9944","978-1-7281-5023-9","10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9022413","auto encoders;morphometry;currents;exponentiation;shape analysis;topology","Topology;Shape;Kernel;Computer architecture;Measurement;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction","","","","34","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although such platform is capable of achieving high performance at relatively low cost, the system architecture of CMP brings new challenges in system development and increases complexity in developing embedded software especially at the level of kernel or operating system. This paper presents our experience and some preliminary results from building a multi-kernel embedded system with high performance Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism for application software running on the platform of a newly developed multi-core SOC, namely PAC Duo SOC, which is the latest product from the PAC (short for Parallel Architecture Core) Project implemented at Industry Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in Taiwan. PAC Duo SOC is a heterogeneous multi-processor SOC composed of one ARM926 core serving as the general purpose processor (GPP) and two ITRI PAC DSP cores serving as the special purpose processors (SPP). We ported Linux operating system to run on the ARM926 processor and ported the real-time kernel Micro-C/OS-II to run on one PAC DSP core, leaving the other PAC DSP core with the option of running either another Micro-C/OS-II or a different kernel. To address the issues in IPC, a high performance message-passing mechanism is developed. Its design not only takes application-specific requirements into account but also takes advantages of hardware features.","","978-1-4577-1564-8","10.1109/HPCC.2011.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6063032","embedded system;multi-core;operating system;Linux;IPC;Micro-C/OS-II","Digital signal processing;Kernel;System-on-a-chip;Embedded systems;Multicore processing;Hardware","","4","","33","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Matrix profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm to perform time series analysis, computes the most similar subsequence for a given query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low arithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series data. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy. In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three key benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of applications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses between the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time series data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental evaluation shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2× (9.9× on average) and reduces energy by up to 27.2 × (19.4 × on average), over the state-of-the-art multi-core implementation. NATSA also improves performance by 6.3 × and reduces energy by 10.2 × over a general-purpose NDP platform with 64 in-order cores.","2576-6996","978-1-7281-9710-4","10.1109/ICCD50377.2020.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283516","","Time series analysis;Memory management;Bandwidth;Prediction algorithms;Energy efficiency;Computational efficiency;System-on-chip","","22","","113","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This code from smaller units to sub systems and sometimes even fully functional autonomous components is, at times, required in other projects due to related needs across the enterprise. In the absence of a component model based development, it becomes nearly impossible to organize, maintain and reuse such code. The challenge of meeting enterprise automation needs vis-à-vis an ever shrinking project timeline tends to provide for lesser code documentation time. This results into poorly documented source code that though provides required functionality on time and meets user requirements accurately, yet allows for minimal reuse, mostly relying on developer's memory and is difficult to maintain. This problem is typically faced by newly built IT infrastructures in public sector organizations when business processes are being automated and new business requirements for automation keep accumulating. The job of a solution designer becomes complex when source code and component information is not organized in a way that allows for it to be reused in an upcoming project. This paper proposes a framework for documenting source code of custom developed enterprise application software that may not conform to a component model in the form of XML descriptors. Resultantly, it becomes possible to enhance the readability and opportunistic reuse of otherwise non reusable source code.","2327-0594","978-1-4799-8353-7","10.1109/ICSESS.2015.7339004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7339004","XML;Software Reuse;Custom Enterprise Applications;Software Documentation","Documentation;XML;Software reusability;Business;Automation","","1","","12","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CPPSs require acquisition of production system data and smart data processing to extract information to improve the overall system performance. To achieve that it is needed to bridge the gap between the control systems and higher layers.

We demonstrate how to leverage these interconnect structures to effectively support data movement requirements of dense machine learning (ML) workloads at URAM-limited 650MHz frequency (714MHz reported by Vivado). We refor-mulate convolution and matrix-vector multiplication operations to make effective use of cascade interconnect (1) in DSP48s for supporting the common multiply-accumulate chains, and (2) in BRAMs, and URAMs to exploit the data movement and reuse patterns of ML workloads. The use of these dedicated cascade interconnect are an alternative to Versal AI cores that throw away FPGA flexibility in favor of rigid ASIC components with unproven long-term value. Our 650MHz operation on the Xilinx VU37P UltraScale+ FPGA is competitive with the 720 MHz state-of-the-art Xilinx SuperTile design.

To achieve the goal of servitization that the Industry 4.0 world requires, a modernization of current production chains is needed. This common demand comes mostly from manufacturing sector, where complex work machines collaborate with human workers. The data produced by the machines must be processed quickly, to allow the implementation of reactive services such as predictive maintenance, and remote control, always taking care of the safety of nearby people. This paper proposes a multi-layer architecture to monitor legacy production machines during their operations inside customers plants. The platform provides near real-time delivery of data collected from the machines with a high grade of customization according to customer needs.

In particular, we propose a Green parallel forwarding and switching (GPFS) architecture in which the IP lookups and packet switching for multiple packets are overlapped by accessing different FSN (in different stages) for different packets at the same time.

To align with this initiative, there is a need to transform the specification into real products with the necessary components and interfaces following the ETSI reference architecture. To support this effort, in this article we share our experience in the exploration of further refining and developing internal components of the ETSI NFV-MANO functional blocks with identified open integration interfaces. We focus on the detailed analysis of the life cycle management of the Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), which is the most fundamental and important functionality of NFV-MANO. Based on our analysis, we propose an abstract VNF Manager Integration Interface (VNFM Integration Interface) at the southbound of VNFM, to integrate with various clouds and systems to complete the life cycle management of the VNFs. In order to achieve advanced VNF life cycle management such as auto-scaling, a model-based monitoring solution is adopted for monitoring the VNFs across multiple layers of NFV architecture. To serve as a proof of concept, we automatically deploy and scale a sample VNF using the proposed software architecture and interfaces. With the prototyping experience using the VNF model as a plugin, to integrate with traditional virtualization and physical infrastructure hierarchy as a full topology model, we evaluate using a model-based monitoring system Dell Foglight™ for realizing NFV monitoring functionalities as part of NFV-MANO architecture framework.","","978-3-9018-8277-7","10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367393","Network Function Virtualization (NFV);NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO);cloud managed software;virtualized IP network;NFV monitoring","Decision support systems","","8","","10","","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DFMU extends the geometric integration of product models, as provided by traditional DMUs, with functional aspects. Thus, it allows investigating both physical and logic model properties. Additionally, DFMUs build the foundation for an integrated analysis of holistic behavioural aspects of a product. The design of DFMUs is validated by performing a cost-efficient co-simulation — a methodology for simulating individual components concurrently by different simulation tools which mutually exchange information in a collaborative manner. This process can be highly cross-organisational and thus requires an exchange of cost-sensitive and confidential product models between suppliers and OEMs. This paper discusses the deployment of service-oriented architectures in co-simulation environments for (a) improving the configuration process, (b) protecting the intellectual property of the model owners, and (c) introducing electronic signatures to simulation models, data and results. Furthermore, it presents the concept of a functional mock-up trust centre (FMTC) which implements part of these services. The FMTC is a practical and effective instrument to preserve intellectual property rights of model providers during co-simulation.

Content-based filtering techniques effectively provide relevant product recommendations based on user actions on the E-commerce platform. However, with the rapid growth of products and product data, content-based filtering faces several challenges, particularly in feature extraction. Conventional feature extraction methods cannot capture the wide range of product characteristics that influence consumer preferences. In addition, as the number of features extracted increases, the computation time and memory requirements also increase, making it difficult to scale the system. In this paper, we propose the use of various deep learning techniques like conventional Natural Language Processing(NLP) methods, transformer-based methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Autoencoders to develop 12 models for a recommendation system. Our work aims to identify products with similar textual descriptions and visual appearances to generate accurate recommendations. The 12 models are divided into three categories based on the type of feature extraction techniques used. The proposed approach uses self-attention to extract text features and powerful image feature extraction techniques to effectively capture the product characteristics and address the limitations of traditional methods. After extensive experimentation and evaluation through A/B testing, we observed that the best-performing model is based on a transformer, CNN, and autoencoder. The model generated accurate recommendations and achieved significantly higher user ratings, with an average of 9.9 out of 10 points.

Second, it reports our reliability assessment findings for the target structures, when the GPU executes a diverse set of twelve GPGPU applications. Third, it discusses remarkable differences in the results of fault injection when the applications are simulated in the virtual NVIDIA GPUs instruction set (ptx) vs. the actual instruction set (sass). Finally, it discusses how the framework can be employed either by architects in the early stages of design phase or by programmers for a GPU application's error resilience enhancement.","","978-1-5090-1953-3","10.1109/ISPASS.2016.7482077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482077","reliability assessment;fault injection;GPGPU;microarchitecture simulators","Graphics processing units;Hardware;Reliability;Computer architecture;Registers;Microarchitecture;Kernel","","46","1","26","IEEE","2 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several laws to monitor and govern networks that ensure the privacy and security of consumers. However, they do not control the infrastructure or hardware dependency associated with these networks. A robust end-to-end network requires reliable hardware, software, and network architecture to handle multiple failures, increased users, and increased traffic demands. To handle multiple failures efficiently, there must be little to no dependency on the manufacturers involved. Therefore, the robustness of a network requires an adequate degree of sovereignty. In this study, Data Center Networks (DCN) are considered to understand the impact of choosing the hardware and software manufacturers appropriately on the DCN robustness. The unavailability of a component from a manufacturer or the presence of a software bug in the switches of a DCN can affect several flows, leading to multiple failures and huge losses of data. Thus, it is rational to find the best combination of manufacturers to create a network with the least dependency on the manufacturer(s). In this research, the sovereignty of a DCN is evaluated by considering different multiple-failure scenarios based on hardware and software manufacturers' reliability. Design guidelines for DCN operators are provided based on the findings of the analyses.","","978-1-6654-7092-6","10.1109/ICSRS56243.2022.10067479","Ministry of Economic Affairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10067479","sovereignty;reliability;data center","Data centers;Wireless networks;Computer bugs;Software;Robustness;Hardware;Topology","","5","","28","IEEE","21 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a scenario-oriented blockchain system for drug traceability and regulation called Drugledger, which reconstructs the whole service architecture by separating service provider into three independent service components and ensures the authenticity and privacy of traceability data. Drugledger is more resilient than traditional solutions with its p2p architecture. Furthermore, Drugledger could efficiently prune its storage, achieving a finally stable and acceptable blockchain storage. Besides, algorithms reflecting the real drug supply chain logic (e.g, package, repackage, unpackage, etc.) are designed based on the expanded UTXO workflow in Drugledger.

Due to the increasing requests for personalized health insurance recommendation, traditional ways of obtaining recommended health insurance products from experts or agents are insufficient, and thus automatic personalized health insurance recommendation is needed. However, existing approaches to addressing this problem either need heavy input from users to obtain the utility of health insurance products for recommendation, or directly rely on user feedback and neglect the utility in recommendation. In this paper, we propose an automatic personalized health insurance recommendation system that incorporates both utility-based recommendation and user feedback based recommendation. To achieve that, we propose a two-component architecture in our system, where the first component is for daily operations to provide utility-based personalized recommendation for users with simple input of health risks, and the second component is to refine the first component by learning dynamic user preferences from user feedback data and combine the learnt preferences into utility-based recommendation. On a complex real-world insurance dataset, our proposed system achieves 2x more effectiveness than the baseline approaches for improving the recommendation quality.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-8164-1","10.1109/ICDMW60847.2023.00174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411539","Recommendation;Insurance","Conferences;Insurance;Data models;Data mining;Recommender systems","","1","","27","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Hamming neural network is an effective tool for solving these problems when the initial information is given in the form of bipolar vectors. However, when comparing binary objects with qualitative features, more than 70 different distances (proximity measures) and proximity functions of binary objects are used. Synthesizing dozens of neural networks for matching binary objects is too laborious. Therefore, a universal approach to the synthesis of such neural networks is proposed. In addition, the Hamming network can select only one object from its memory that is closest to the input. It cannot function normally if there are two or more such objects. The proposed neural network does not have this shortcoming. And last but not least, a neural network with this architecture allows you to calculate various distances and similarity measures of the input data and data stored in the network memory","","979-8-3503-9920-2","10.1109/KhPIWeek57572.2022.9916368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916368","hamming neural network;similarity measure;distance;binary feature vector;qualitative features","Atmospheric measurements;Neural networks;Area measurement;Neurons;Computer architecture;Artificial neural networks;Particle measurements","","","","9","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Significant effort has been put into the hardware acceleration of convolution and fully-connected layers of neural networks, while not too much attention has been put on the Softmax layer. Softmax is used in terminal classification layers in networks like ResNet, and is also used in intermediate layers in networks like the Transformer. As the speed for other DNN layers keeps improving, efficient and flexible designs for Softmax are required. With the existence of several ways to implement Softmax in hardware, we evaluate various softmax hardware designs and the trade-offs between them. In order to make the design space exploration more efficient, we also develop a parameterized generator which can produce softmax designs by varying multiple aspects of a base architecture. The aspects or knobs are parallelism, accuracy, storage and precision. The goal of the generator is to enable evaluation of tradeoffs between area, delay, power and accuracy in the architecture of a softmax unit. We simulate and synthesize the generated designs and present results comparing them with the existing state-of-the-art. Our exploration reveals that the design with parallelism of 16 can provide the best area-delay product among designs with parallelism ranging from 1 to 32. It is also observed that look-up table based approximate LOG and EXP units can be used to yield almost the same accuracy as the full LOG and EXP units, while providing area and energy benefits. Additionally, providing local registers for intermediate values is seen to provide energy savings.","2160-052X","978-1-7281-7147-0","10.1109/ASAP49362.2020.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153236","Softmax;DNN;Machine LearningDesign Space Exploration","Computer architecture;Parallel processing;Hardware;Generators;Space exploration;Adders;Training","","16","","14","IEEE","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a simple and effective approach, inspired by attention, to fuse discriminative features from different modalities. We propose a novel attention mechanism, called Flattened Outer Arithmetic Attention (FOAA), which relies on outer arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, product, and division) to compute attention scores from keys, queries and values derived from flattened embeddings of each modality.

These systems are systematicaly developed from a common set of core assets. Objective: This paper proposes SyMPLES-CVL, an alternative approach to the management of variability based on SysML models to support the development of SPLs for embedded systems. In addition, we present a comparative study between our previous approach, SyMPLES-SMarty, and SyMPLES-CVL. Method: SyMPLES-CVL was specified based on SyMPLES-SMarty, then an experimental study was carry to compare the approaches. A total of 20 participants with Software Engineering background were divided into two groups, one for each approach. The data were collected with the support of questionnaires which was analysed based on test hypotheses using inferential statistics. Results: SyMPLES-CVL was not considered significantly more effective than SyMPLES-SMarty at an significance level of 0.05 for T-Test test. Limitations: Generalization of results is limited due to the sample size of this study. Conclusion: The results showed that the approaches compared did not have a significant difference in terms of effectiveness, although they use different means (annotative and compositional) for the management of variability in SPLs.

In this paper, we propose a novel fault injection technique to evaluate the reliability of a computing system running a software at early design stage where the hardware architecture is not completely defined yet. The proposed approach efficiently operates on the original source code of the software in order to inject transient faults in the data or the instructions. To be accurate and to achieve a better characterization of the system, we simulate faults occurring in the system memory units such as the data cache and the RAM by developing a system emulator. To validate our approach, we compare the simulation results to those obtained with an FPGA-based fault injector. The similarity of the results proves the accuracy of our approach to evaluate system reliability with a gain in the execution time and without requiring a fully defined hardware system.","","978-1-5090-2467-4","10.1109/DDECS.2016.7482446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7482446","Reliability;Soft Errors;Fault Injection;Software;Cache;RAM;Memory","Random access memory;Hardware;Software;Software reliability;Computer architecture;Reliability engineering","","5","","16","IEEE","2 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relevant numerical algorithm selected to address the problem is power method, which is widely used to compute the dominant eigenvalue of a matrix. This work focuses on dense linear algebra. The frequently used multi-core or many-core processor parallelism techniques include OpenMP, Intel Cilk Plus, Intel Threading Building Blocks, i.e. TBB, along with the optimized computing libraries such as Intel Math Kernel Library(MKL) or the NVIDIA CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines(cuBLAS) library. Optimized implementations of these techniques were separately applied to the aforementioned architectures. For the reason that a unitary programming model may not satisfy the growing performance demand, we also explored some possible mix of these languages. The study shows that the hybrid pattern of multithreading and data parallelism via explicit vectorization maximizes the performance on x86 architectures, which allows us to obtain 80% of the sustainable peak performance in double precision on the Intel Many Integrated Core(MIC) Architecture. In the case of single precision, this number reaches even 96%. In addition, this approach enables a reasonable performance by requiring least developing time. The numbers of iterations till convergence are roughly the same in both architectures of CPU and GPU. The GPU performs better in small matrix sizes. However, the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor excels for large sizes with a better scalability.","","978-0-7695-5094-7","10.1109/3PGCIC.2013.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681224","","Coprocessors;Vectors;Kernel;Graphics processing units;Arrays;Computational modeling","","3","","18","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NVM introduces additional data migration possibilities to the traditional buffer pool (BP) managers used by the DBMS. Hence, the efficient use of this new technology requires a re-design of the BP manager. For the cloud Database-as-a-Service products, this need for a re-design is further complicated by the traditional cloud providers' goal to minimize the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation penalties paid to their tenants. Unfortunately, current research in the area does not provide a comprehensive picture of the components constituting a multi-tenant persistent memory aware BP manager for a cloud database that makes use of NVM. Furthermore, researchers lack the software tools needed to quickly prototype and estimate the effectiveness of novel data management policies guiding those components. In this paper, we attempt to remedy both issues, first, by proposing a generalized framework that defines the purpose and the abstract interfaces of various multitenant persistent memory-aware BP manager components, and second, by developing and demonstrating a simulator algorithm that is shown to aid in quick testing of different implementations of those BP manager components.","2473-3490","978-1-7281-4266-1","10.1109/ICDEW49219.2020.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9094123","database systems;nonvolatile memory;buffer storage;cloud computing;simulation","Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Cloud computing;Database systems;Software;Buffer storage","","1","","10","IEEE","15 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hydrological observations in various kinds are essential for constraining a reliable set of parameters for hydrological simulations. Soil moisture, which is listed among the fifty essential climate variables by the Global Climate Observing System, plays a crucial role in this process. Due to practical issues, when estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in basin-scale hydrological modelling, RSSM products are a viable solution over in-situ measurements. In this study, the ABCD hydrological model was used to simulate soil moisture in different seasons of the watershed. Finally, the RSSM data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP L4) satellite were integrated with the soil moisture estimations from the hydrological model to recalibrate the parameters. The findings of this study suggest that the integration of SMAP L4 to the ABCD model has no significant impact in enhancing the accuracy.

The key observation is that the BPA begins to yield at least 25% better (lower) Energy Delay Product (EDP) as compared to that in BSA for large (2048x2048) sub-array sizes. The BSA yields $4 \times$ lower delay on an average, while the BPA yields $\sim 6 \times$ lower dynamic energy.

Advancements in neural network software architectures and algorithms however remain out-of-step with circuit-level design innovations in building power- and area- efficient analog hardware for the matrix multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations: The computing workhorse of modern CNNs. This article proposes a modelling framework for evaluating non-ideal analog MAC circuit components in quantization-aware training (QAT) CNNs. The CNN network parameters including image and kernel data are mapped to a physical crossbar array model of analog-in-memory computing (AIMC) or serialized MACs. Different mapping strategies such as weight stationary (WS), output stationary (OS) and partial-product quantization (PPQ) techniques are explored. The implications of using non-ideal AIMC components incorporating gain, nonlinearity, noise non-idealities, and mismatch variations are investigated. The hardware-aware modelling framework provides a valuable toolkit for analog designers to estimate the effects of block/circuit-level analog MAC design specifications on the overall system-level CNN network accuracy. Our hardware-aware CNN evaluations reveal simple CNNs can tolerate analog non-idealities to an extent, therefore guide analog designers on how best to optimize the analog MAC circuits in a power- and area-efficient manner to avoid hardware over-design.","2688-1454","979-8-3503-5298-6","10.1109/ISSC61953.2024.10603107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10603107","Hardware-aware evaluation;deep neural network (DNN) acceleration;analog in-memory computing;multiply-and-accumulate;non-ideal neural networks;quantized neural networks;mixed -signal computing","Training;Technological innovation;Software architecture;Computational modeling;Noise;Neural networks;Software algorithms","","","","17","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And a big amount of annotated data is the essential cornerstone to reach this success. However, in the medical domain, it is usually difficult (and sometimes even impossible) to get sufficient data for some specific learning tasks. Consequently, in this work, a novel data augmentation solution, called semi-supervised attention-guided CycleGAN (SSA-CycleGAN) is proposed to resolve this problem. Specifically, a cycle-consistency GANs-based model is first proposed to generate synthetic tumor (resp., normal) images from normal (resp., tumor) images. Then, a semi-supervised attention module is further proposed to enhance the model's capability in learning the important details of the training images, which in turns help the generated synthetic images become more realistic. To verify its effectiveness, experimental studies are conducted on three medical image datasets with limited amounts of MRI images, and the proposed SSA-CycleGAN is applied to generate synthetic tumor and normal MRI images for data augmentation. Experimental results show that i) SSA-CycleGAN can add (resp., remove) tumor lesions on (resp., from) the original normal (resp., tumor) images and generate very realistic synthetic tumor (resp. normal) images; and ii) in the ResNet18-based MRI image classification tasks based on these datasets, data augmentation using SSA-CycleGAN achieves much better classification performances than the classic data augmentation methods.","","978-1-7281-1867-3","10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8982932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8982932","Generative adversarial networks (GANs);Data Augmentation;Attention module;Medical image processing","","","25","","22","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This difficulty restricts the ability of developers to annotate code that they have not written themselves. This paper provides one fundamental component in the solution of this problem. We introduce a static program analysis that infers the bounds of memory regions referenced in source code. Such bounds allow us to automatically insert data-transfer primitives, which are needed when the parallelized code is meant to be executed in an accelerator device, such as a GPU. To validate our ideas, we have applied them onto Polybench, using two different architectures: Nvidia and Qualcomm-based. We have successfully analyzed 98% of all the memory accesses in Polybench.

The GTCNN is a compositional architecture with each layer comprising a graph-time convolutional module, a graphtime pooling module, and a nonlinearity. We develop a graph-time convolutional filter by following the shift-and-sum principles of the convolutional operator to learn higher-level features over the product graph. The product graph itself is parametric so that we can learn also the spatiotemporal coupling from data. We develop a zero-pad pooling that preserves the spatial graph (the prior about the data) while reducing the number of active nodes and the parameters.

A key property of the system assuring long-term goals consists on modularity, or else the ability to decouple different components: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes.

There are several types of the AFD including core AFD, unwinding AFD and cyclic AFD, but all of them determine decomposition parameters in accordance with maximal selection principle (MSP). The most common implementation for the MSP is the exhaustive search method, which is time-consuming. Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) support both graphics and general purpose (GP) computing. In this paper we show that the exhaustive search method for the MSP can be easily optimized using low-cost general purpose GPU technologies.

This study proposes a method to implement USB device redirection in a Windows environment based on USB/IP protocol. The architecture of the method will be described in detail in Section 3. Using driver development techniques, the local host side is responsible for local identification and data filtering of hardware devices, and the remote desktop side is responsible for simulating the virtual host controller and virtual devices so that the upper layer applications can use the response data of the acquired hardware devices normally. An effective IP communication channel is established between the two for sending, receiving, parsing, and using the USB device data.

"Assessing/instilling trustworthiness in tactical/sensing networks","A. M. Cheng","Science Applications International Corporation, USA",2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems,"3 Jun 2010","2010","","","557","562","Trusted Layered Sensing has evolved from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) initiative to a vision now shared across government research agencies, industry, and academia. “Trust” is viewed as the most critical issue affecting Layered Sensing architectures since it's impossible to build Situational Awareness (SA) out of inaccurate, misleading, or denied information. Sensing systems (SS) consist of dispersed sensors/applications connected by a network enabling prompt and reliable data dissemination to often remote sites for analysis so decision makers can base their actions. Two widely accepted SA components are: 1. The Sensors which provide the ""sensing"" components and 2. Collaborative, advanced exploitation which provides comprehension (interpretation/ synthesis of data giving meaning in a situation), projection (prediction and simulation aimed at possible outcomes, future scenarios), and resolution (courses of action supporting decisions and planning) This covers the application aspects of SS but overlooks a critical component, the networks themselves. Commonly perpetrated attacks aim at gaining access to and disrupting networks' operation in order to intercept, tamper with, or deny the dissemination of information. Some attacks render networks useless by exploiting their vulnerabilities resulting in the loss of costly assets and even human casualties. Much research focuses on the forensic aspects of classifying threats and assessing damage after attacks have occurred, as documented by various taxonomies that categorize known network attacks. The value of this research is not being minimized, as it is essential in the quest for mechanisms to proactively recognize and combat threats. This paper discusses assessing/instilling trustworthiness in tactical/sensing networks, covers important issues related to the trustworthiness of currently deployed devices, describes our two-pronged approach aimed at 1) proactive defenses against threats and 2) enhanced efficiency and resilience of operation, and highlights collaboration between networking elements as key to achieving these goals.","","978-1-4244-6622-1","10.1109/CTS.2010.5478464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478464","Trust;Trustworthiness;Collaboration;Distributed;Knowledge;Network Cyber-situational Awareness (network cyber-SA)","Collaboration;Force sensors;Laboratories;Government;Sensor systems and applications;Network synthesis;Predictive models;Humans;Forensics;Taxonomy","","1","","6","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The real time analysis can help make decisions in time, and that actions in response to the analysis results must also be performed fast enough to meet the rapid changes in the demands from customers and regulators. The ACP (Artificial systems/societies, Computational experiments and Parallel execution) approach has provided us an opportunity to use various methods in modeling and analyzing a complex system in real time. We can build up artificial systems to reflect how the actual systems could be running. Computational experiments are performed to analyze different scenarios or different configurations of the system. The parallel execution provides a mechanism for using the results from the experiments on the artificial systems to guide the real system. In this paper, we present our approach of applying ACP to establishing a real-time business intelligence system.

Nonetheless, parallel theory provides strategies for parallel finite automata evaluation. We show how to exploit this parallel evaluation strategy in practice on today's high capacity FPGAs, including a novel formulation for spatially pipelined evaluation. For non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) with S states, we can evaluate N inputs in a single cycle with O(N * S2) BRAMs and O(N*S3) LUTs. This allows us, for example, to consume 64 inputs on a 16 state NFA in a single cycle on the Xilinx XZCU9EG-ffvb1156-2-i SoC FPGA, achieving 47 GB/s (377 Gb/s) single stream throughput for 8b inputs.

However, this process will be slow and high memory required when dealing with high precision map or enormous data. A fast cartography approach based on run length coding is proposed in this paper. The main idea is to express map symbol using run length set rather than dot matrix, thus the disposal of various form of symbol, linetype or label in cartography pattern can achieve through the operation of run length set, which will largely cut down redundant information emerged in the process of map rendering. The core of our scheme is geographical element expression with run-length set and run length overlay calculation of multiple layers, specifically to explore how map symbol and cartographic products are created by using run-length code. A detailed description about design of dot-form symbol is presented in this paper. We argue that dot-form symbol is a block of different size run-length segment, which records the complete color attribute. The design of complex symbol is built through the operation of fundamental run-length block, which have been implemented in previous research. In addition, other styles of map symbol can create in the same pattern. Based on this representation, it is actually plug in a block of run-length when insert a symbol into map layer. Thus, the map document can be taken as a set of run-length in different layers. While the map product is the final superposition effect of layers, combination of run-length block in each layer is necessary for the ultimate cartography pattern. The procedure is as follows: (1) progressive scan cartography space; (2) compare each layer with uppermost layer to determine merge or resolve run-length blocks to form ultimate run-length set, which is executed by adding operation of run-length for layers. The rules of disposing run-length block or not is discussed in detail. Thereby, all cartography features are contained in the final run-length set and map export will be realized in a short time for smaller memory space. The advantages of the scheme in speed and memory consumption are illustrated by comparative analysis with existing cartography system. Simultaneously, performance analysis concerning thematic map series is made at the end of this paper.","2161-0258","978-1-4244-7303-8","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2010.5567724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567724","computer cartography;run-length operation;map symbol design;run-length set","Encoding;Spatial databases;Data visualization;Libraries;Image color analysis;Data structures","","","","10","IEEE","9 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design patterns in SOA have been identified by T. Erl [1]. However, they are represented in form which is suitable for humans, but not for computers. In context of machine processing formal representation of patterns would be advantageous.

In this paper, we have proposed an aggregation-based indirect architecture for advanced metering infrastructure architecture in smart grid Internet of Things and focused on finding the optimum number of regional aggregators in its neighborhood area network (NAN) based on three metrics: regional aggregator (RA) power consumption, cost of RAs and wide-area aggregator, and NAN lifetime. We have developed a power consumption model for each RA and define NAN lifetime based on that. We also defined a new performance metric, the product of power consumption and cost (PC), so that by minimizing it, we can obtain the optimum number of RAs.

Almost any vehicular computer system comprehends at least one CAN line. For the past two decades, software development for control system has been strongly connected to the properties and interfaces of the CAN bus. Currently, the automotive industry is in the middle of a technology leap towards an information-based industry. New technologies are getting ready to fulfill newly emerging requirements for innovative products such as hybrid engine control, intelligent energy management, and advanced driver assistance systems. Integrated Multi-Processor-on-a-Chips (MPSoCs) will be one part of the solution to provide an adequate computing infrastructure for these newly emerging systems. The established technologies like the CAN bus will have to be reconsidered. In this work, we propose a virtual CAN overlay that abstracts the communication interfaces of an MPSoC to provide the Application Programmer Interface (API) of CAN to programmers. The overlay provides the standard behavior of a CAN line and works transparently over chip boundaries. The major implications is that the programmers can continue their used software development approaches and tools when introducing a new computing infrastructure. The main benefit is that the productivity can be maintained during this critical phase. In summary, our solution helps to mitigate the effects from a technology shift to integrated MPSoCs. Our approach is fully compliant with new automotive software development approaches like AUTOSAR.","2375-5261","978-1-4799-4430-9","10.1109/ISORC.2014.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899144","Integrated Architecture;Middleware;Legacy system;CAN;AUTOSAR","Logic gates;Computer architecture;Hardware;Automotive engineering;Software;Real-time systems;Standards","","6","","20","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the main idea behind cloud computing. In this case, hardware, software and expert personnel can be centrally located and the “services” they provide are accessed over the network. This leads to enhanced flexibility, better accessibility and scalability, and also to higher reliability in service provisioning from which both a service consumer and a service provider will benefit. Modelling and Simulation as a Service is a means of delivering value to customer via network cloud technology by enabling access to M&S applications, capabilities, and data without necessity of ownership. The service approach to Modelling and Simulation capabilities offers benefits like access to M&S services on demand, access to a broader set of applications and tools, sharing and pooling resources, models, data, best practices and other knowledge, which leads to more effective resources exploitation. The paper is based on NATO MSG-136 (“Modelling and Simulation (M&S) as a Service — “Rapid deployment of interoperable and credible simulation environments” group results.

This usually leads to a combination of different deployment tools that are unable to interact with each other in order to provide an unified and automatic service deployment procedure. Therefore, the tools are usually used manually or specifically integrated for a single cloud service, which on the other hand requires changing the entire deployment procedure in case the service gets modified. In this paper we utilize Model-driven development (MDD) approach for building and managing arbitrary cloud services. We define a metamodel of a cloud service called CoPS, which describes a cloud service as a composition of software and hardware elements by using three sequential models, namely Component, Product and Service. We also present an architecture of a Cloud Management System (CMS) that is able to manage such services by automatically transforming the service models from the abstract representation to the actual deployment.

One reason for this is the high variability of control software caused for example by influences from the used hardware or customer-specific adaptations. For reuse of variant-rich control software, this paper presents two component-based strategies namely an approach utilizing the object-oriented extensions of IEC 61131-3 and an approach adopting the use of software product lines from the software engineering domain.

However, in recommendation systems, they have not been exploited fully, and most of the systems rely on traditional collaborative filtering with matrix factorization approaches. In this paper we suggest a novel approach based on deep learning-based augmentation of the collaborative filtering approach for predicting user ratings for different types of media collections in online databases and libraries, including movies, music and book collections. Though there have been few approaches proposed based on deep learning for recommender systems, they were mainly used for modelling additional complementary information available in terms of images, text or acoustic information from different items in the collections. The main component, the interaction between the item and the user was still modelled with traditional matrix factorization approaches, which uses the dot product to extract the latent features between users and items. By augmenting the latent features extracted with deep learning based neural network models, it is possible to capture the hidden interactions and can lead to better recommender system performance even with sparse and unbalanced datasets. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach based on four different publicly available datasets involving movies, music and book collections, show promising results, in terms of different performance metrics including accuracy and mean absolute error. Experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.","","978-1-7281-0404-1","10.1109/iCMLDE.2018.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614014","Deep learning;Recommender system;Collaborative Filtering;Neural Network","Collaboration;Deep learning;Recommender systems;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Computer architecture","","10","","27","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These kinds of simulations are related to reproduce real societies (e.g. social behaviors) using a bottom-up strategy. In classical social simulations, plausible macro-behaviors are only obtained if the social scientists input every features, components and relationships. Alternatively, modern agent-based modeling tools are being designed as discrete-event simulators. This architecture is monolithic, executes serially agent actions and have limited scalability. Aiming at the production of plausible and scalable social simulations, this research has two main goals: (i) introduction of a distributed architecture to build highly scale social simulations and (ii) help social scientists to modeling complex social phenomena in various granularities (i.e. level of detail). We used distributed computation concepts to balance the computational demand of a high scale social simulation. The proposed architecture allows simulations of large social region and their population. For validating the proposed approach and architecture, we simulated the consumption phenomenon on Recipe (the 4th-largest metropolitan area in Brazil). We performed a comparative analysis between the distributed computational approaches with an econometric model. Results revel significant gain in similarity when compared the data produced by the distributed model with the real phenomenon. The proposed architecture can be used for building support decision tools for training public officers on high impact social decisions.","","978-1-61284-060-4","10.1109/IA.2011.5953615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953615","Agent-Based Social Simulations;Distributed Computing;Agent Based Modeling","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Shape;Analytical models;Microprocessors;Protocols;Distributed computing","","3","","19","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The systems are often one-off complex implementations tailored to the needs of that particular stakeholder. System components may communicate with other internal legacy components like accounting and warehousing systems or external third-party components that handle order processing, security screening, or shipping-related tasks. From time to time, stakeholders may need to adapt their systems by replacing or modifying one or more of the sub-system components to operate on new hardware, communicate with other components using different data communication techniques, or to interact with new external third-party solutions. It is therefore useful for solutions for the individual components to be designed with an architecture that lend themselves to be easily reengineered or replaced without disturbing the other system components, and without adding significant complexity to the overall system of systems. In prior works, the authors of this paper introduced in a series of case studies a repeatable architectural design pattern that implemented self-adaptive autonomic interaction managers (AIMs) that not only reduced or eliminated the need for human operators to monitor, tune, or troubleshoot the implemented components, but could be easily modified or reengineered in the future to adapt to new operating environments. The contribution of this paper is the testing of the efficacy of the AIM design introduced in prior works by the authors, by simulating the reengineering of a set of AIMs tasked with handling web-based order traffic between the stakeholder system and Amazon.com. In this effort, the AIMs were re-implemented on a different operating system, coded in a different programming language than the original implementation, using a different data communication protocol to communicate with other systems. The authors simulated web-based order traffic to test the resulting implementation. The effort demonstrated that using the original autonomic design patter, AIMs could be rapidly adapted to a new environment, while maintaining original behavior and without adding complexity to the stakeholder's system.","2472-9647","978-1-5090-4623-2","10.1109/SYSCON.2017.7934780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934780","software engineering;software reengineering;legacy systems;autonomic computing","Stakeholders;Simple object access protocol;Servers;Aging;C++ languages","","2","","12","IEEE","29 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To effectively tackle the large dynamic fluctuations in workload engendered by user-centric services, effective energy management schemes must be in place to modulate power consumption according to the actual processing load in each installation. In this respect, service orchestrators and multi- and cross-cloud energy management systems need proper tools to understand how power consumption would change with different placement decisions, both in the single as well as in federated clouds. In this paper, we describe a framework for exploring the trade-off between performance and energy consumption. Our work builds on the availability of both resource usage and power consumption measurements in Cloud Management Software, and makes proper correlation between these values to effectively support energy-efficiency strategies. We describe the implementation of energy monitoring framework in OpenStack, which leverages available features in the Ceilometer component.","","978-1-5386-2859-1","10.1109/FMEC.2017.7946418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946418","","Cloud computing;Power demand;Servers;Green products;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Computer architecture","","7","","22","IEEE","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A primary element of this isolation is hardware and low-level software (e.g. operating system) independence. A design pattern documents a reference design for the solution to a recurring problem encountered in object-oriented software development. The fundamental theme of design patterns is to encapsulate the concepts that vary.

In this paper, we have presented a system that will be able to predict possible asthma attack for individuals and alert them. The system is developed using an air pollutant monitoring device combined with an Android application. Using supervised learning technique and analyzing (frequently taken) air pollutant data, the system will help to reduce asthma attacks for asthma patients. Also analyzing personalized data of individuals it will be possible to recommend a new user about the safe and unsafe zone of the city.

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning approach that automatically learns image features for object recognition tasks using an object detector. Therefore, this paper proposed a recent object detection model, YOLOv5m, to develop a plastic waste detection model. Two plastic waste datasets, which consist of red, green, and blue (RGB) and red, green, and near-infrared (RGNIR) images, are introduced to train the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on the two datasets. The proposed model achieves the best result on RGNIR datasets for validation and testing with an average mAP@0.5:0.95 value of 69.39% and 69.45%, respectively.

The Object Naming Service (ONS), a directory based on the Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the important components of the EPC network. ONS provides a connection between the product code and Information Services (IS) in IoT systems. However, object identification standards used by these IoT information systems are usually customized and inhomogeneous. Therefore it is difficult to integrate these systems for real-time data sharing. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an extension of ONS architecture to dynamically support heterogeneous object code identification. A syntax called Formal Decoding Rule (FDR) is designed to define the rules of parsing object code, so that decoding rules can be decoupled from ONS hardcode program. Object Identifier (OID) is imported to manage heterogeneous code rules, which offers open registration of new identification standards by IoT subscribers and allows real-time updates in the ONS network. And there is a one-to-one correspondence between FDR and OID. In a typical query, ONS first detects the OID of an object, finds its corresponding FDR and then resolves the object code to corresponding resource address according to this FDR. By this mechanism, IoT applications with different object code identification standards is possible to be integrated into a larger network to implement real-time data sharing. In addition, this extended ONS architecture can dynamically support heterogeneous web service interface resolving. This paper presents experimental results to illustrate a better performance of ONS using FDR than usual ONS.","0730-3157","978-1-5386-2667-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377709","Internet of Things;Object Naming Service;Identification","Standards;Product codes;Servers;Information systems;Decoding;Companies;Information services","","10","","28","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is additionally complicated by complex system designs of Real-time Interactive Systems (RISs), required for Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality, as well as computer games. If such systems incorporate AI methods, as required for the implementation of multimodal interfaces or smart environments, it is even further exacerbated. Existing approaches strive to establish software technical solutions to support the close temporal and semantic coupling required for multimodal processing and at the same time preserve a general decoupling principle between involved software modules. We present two key solutions that target the semantic coupling issue: (1) a semantics-based access scheme to principal elements of the application state and (2) the specification of effects by means of semantic function descriptions for multimodal processing.

Along with mobile technology towards multifunction, design-for-reliability for mobile becomes challenging and essential. Among of reliability issues, the solder joint reliability of electronic package plays a more important role than before. This study focuses on temperature cycling (TC) solder joint reliability (SJR) performance of Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 3.1 fine pitch BGA (FBGA) package which enables faster read and write performance. Numerical studies were conducted by using the finite element analysis (FEA) technique to investigate the impact of partial underfill on SJR performance. Firstly, three patterns with no-underfill, partial underfill and full underfill are investigated in this study. Secondly, involved the thermal reliability performance of three different types of reworkable and non-reworkable underfill to compare CTE and Tg effect. This paper uncovered the reworkable underfill with high CTE may contribute negatively to thermal cycling SJR reliability. Reworkable underfill with high CTE aims to achieve excellent drop test performance with low manufacture cost. This trade-off may increase potential SJR failure risk under temperature cycling condition.","","979-8-3503-9885-4","10.1109/EPTC56328.2022.10013204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10013204","","Costs;5G mobile communication;Electronic packaging thermal management;Finite element analysis;Thermal analysis;Reliability;Soldering","","4","","7","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data intensive computing is challenging because there is a five-orders-of-magnitude latency gap between main memory DRAM and spinning hard disks; the result is that an inordinate amount of time in data intensive computing is spent accessing data on disk. To address this problem we designed and built a prototype data intensive supercomputer named DASH that exploits flash-based Solid State Drive (SSD) technology and also virtually aggregated DRAM to fill the latency gap . DASH uses commodity parts including Intel® X25-E flash drives and distributed shared memory (DSM) software from ScaleMP®. The system is highly competitive with several commercial offerings by several metrics including achieved IOPS (input output operations per second), IOPS per dollar of system acquisition cost, IOPS per watt during operation, and IOPS per gigabyte (GB) of available storage. We present here an overview of the design of DASH, an analysis of its cost efficiency, then a detailed recipe for how we designed and tuned it for high data-performance, lastly show that running data-intensive scientific applications from graph theory, biology, and astronomy, we achieved as much as two orders-of- magnitude speedup compared to the same applications run on traditional architectures.","2167-4337","978-1-4244-7559-9","10.1109/SC.2010.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645466","","Random access memory;Tuning;Spinning;Drives;Software;Measurement;Memory management","","29","","47","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this challenging context, the paper addresses three novel research contributions. First, we propose a generic architecture for UAV-based inventory management within large-scale warehouses, including the components of UAV path planning, package identification (via QR Codes), data validation (via the Blockchain) and wireless charging; a prototype implementation of the data acquisition and management framework has been conducted by using low-cost mini-drones and single-board computers. Second, we analyze the system performance and specifically the trade-off between the inventory accuracy, i.e. rate of successful package identification, and the inventory completion time.

In this paper, we introduce a lossy transform coding approach, inspired by image and video compression, designed to reduce the memory bandwidth due to the storage of intermediate activation calculation results. Our method does not require fine-tuning the network weights and halves the data transfer volumes to the main memory by compressing feature maps, which are highly correlated, with variable length coding.

In order for the verification of the developed JPIC SDK, four JPIC drivers are developed for the public information in Korea on the harmful food, public jobs, performances & shows and weather & disaster forecast. In addition, an application for the performances & shows in the Android platform is developed using the developed JPIC driver. All the source code developed in this paper is available at KLDP.net for enabling the public access.","","978-1-4577-0524-3","10.1109/ISPAW.2011.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5952001","Public information;SDK;Java;REST;JDBC;Architecture;Open API;XML;Dom tree;URI","Driver circuits;Java;Web pages;Computer architecture;Servers;Databases;Loading","","","","27","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study we show that it is feasible to calculate the mean and variance using the entire training dataset instead of standard BN for any network node obtained as a linear function of the input features. We dub this method Full Batch Normalization (FBN).

However, understanding the causality of an event or between events by traditional machine learning-based techniques from natural language text is a challenging task due to the complexity of the language to be comprehended by the machines. In this study, the Knowledge-oriented convolutional neural network (K-CNN) technique is used to extract the causal relation from online news articles related to the South China Sea (SCS) dispute. The proposed K-CNN model contains a Knowledge-oriented channel that can capture the causal phrases of causal relationships. A Data-oriented channel that captures the position information was added to the K-CNN model in this phase. The online news articles were collected from the national news agency and then the sentences which contain relation such as causal, message-topic, and product-producer were extracted. Then, the extracted sentences were annotated and converted into lower form and base form followed by transformed into the vector by looking up the word embedding table. A word filter that contains causal keywords was generated and a K-CNN model was developed, trained, and tested using the collected data. Finally, different architectures of the K-CNN model were compared to find out the most suitable architecture for this study. From the study, it was found out that the most suitable architecture was the K-CNN model with a Knowledge-oriented channel and a Data-oriented channel with average pooling. This shows that the linguistic clues and the position features can improve the performance in extracting the causal relation from the SCS online news articles.

Its strategic importance is undeniable in supporting the global economy. However, consumerization, which refers to excessive consumption and dependence on resources, has contributed to crises in numerous countries across different regions. Energy consumption is also a severe problem worldwide, especially in industrialized countries, including Kalimantan, Indonesia. The dominant primary energy type in the energy supply mix in 2020 is coal, accounting for about 38.5% of the national total, followed by oil at about 32.8%, gas at about 17.4%, and the rest at about 11.3% through New Renewable Energy (NRE). Therefore, it is necessary to review the energy planning. This paper examines the Long Term Projection of Energy Demand in the Kalimantan Region. Scenarios that are developed include historical data and intervention, which are simulated using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) software. In addition, the basic assumptions used to obtain the projections of population to 2045 are derived from PMAS documents but use a flat or sustainable growth rate of 0.3% from 2045 to 2060, while the GDP growth rate is calculated as a critical resource based on Macro Planning Statistical Analysis (PMAS) by BAPPENAS, Indonesia's National Development Planning Agency. The results of this study are essential to determine the electrification energy demand in Indonesia from various sectors such as the household, commercial, industry, transportation, and others sectors. Thus, the result shows that Kalimantan's household sector electrification energy demand recorded a 2.14% growth rate, while the commercial and industrial sectors energy demand recorded higher growth rates of 6.98% and 6.41%, respectively. The transportation sector, the road transportation sector, which is expected to grow significantly in the future, is the most significant contributor to electricity demand. Road transportation sector electrification energy demand recorded a 25.25%.","","979-8-3503-1867-8","10.1109/ICHVEPS58902.2023.10257313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257313","Energy Demand;Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP);Projection;Electrification;Kalimantan","Road transportation;Energy consumption;Renewable energy sources;Statistical analysis;Oils;Sociology;Transportation","","","","24","IEEE","26 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transform coding utilizing the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) has been commonly adopted in the various standards for image compression. These include the CCITT standard for video telephony, the JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) standard for coloured still-image transmission and the MPEG (Motion Pictures Expert Group) standard for pictures on the storage media. MPEG was originally developed for digital television, its popularity and effectiveness as a storage/transmission format and abundance of content have made it attractive for use in personal video playback devices. DCT based coding schemes are also used for higher quality applications such as HDTV. Therefore, an architecture which rapidly computes DCT has become a key component of image compression VLSIs. This paper reviews the existing efficient algorithms for implementing the reconfigurable Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)/ Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) architecture for multimedia applications and proposed an algorithm which offers high speed and reduced area. The proposed architecture uses an error compensated adder tree to perform shifting and addition operations. The reconfigurable architecture not only decreases the time of research and development but also saves fabrication cost. The advantages of the proposed architecture are that this architecture does not require multipliers and ROM. It only needs adders and shifters. In digital circuits, the area of the multipliers and ROM are larger than adders and shifters.","","","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6396054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6396054","Discrete Cosine Transform;Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform;reconfigurable architecture;VLSI","Computer architecture;Transform coding;Discrete cosine transforms;Very large scale integration;Codecs;Image coding;Encoding","","1","","13","IEEE","31 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As for the defect detection of AOI machine by using the similarity technology, it is very sensitive to different marks, including the different brightness of the font, spacing, brand, word shift and direction. Therefore, it implies that the AOI performance which is reduced as the AOI engineer fails to solve the demanding problem, and results in more time on checking the alarmed images by a human operator. Also, it affects the production yield rate and overall equipment effectiveness. Consequently, in this paper, a novel architecture is proposed to solve such a problem.

The objective of this paper is to identify and describe requirements on Information Systems based on the physical and digital objects of the AM process. Since AM is an uprising manufacturing technology, an exploratory research design is chosen based on semi-structured interviews in German enterprises. Firstly, the digital attributes of an AM part that are crucial to product quality need to be defined. Besides the geometry of an AM part, data from different AM process phases are crucial - e.g. production parameters. Secondly, identification of parts and their virtual representations in different steps of the AM process becomes more relevant. In particular, multiple parts are often arranged in one build job for AM processing but should be traced individually. Thirdly, there is demand to digitally manage diverse manufacturing conditions of AM parts, since a part could be produced by several build jobs on different machines. Fourthly, the integration of AM into existing structures is a key challenge to manufacturers. These requirements will be addressed by an approach based on the Industry 4.0 reference architecture.","","978-1-890843-36-6","10.23919/PICMET.2017.8125398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125398","","Solid modeling;Industries;Three-dimensional printing;Information systems;Collaboration","","2","","36","","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To thoroughly analyze the source of this discrepancy and facilitate real-NVRAM-aware architecture design, we propose a framework that characterizes and models Optane DIMM's microarchitecture. Our framework consists of a Low-level profilEr for Non-volatile memory Systems (LENS) and a Validated cycle-Accurate NVRAM Simulator (VANS). LENS allows us to comprehensively analyze the performance attributes and reverse engineer NVRAM microarchitectures. Based on LENS characterization, we develop VANS, which models the sophisticated microarchitecture design of Optane DIMM, and is validated by comparing with the detailed performance characteristics of Optane-DIMM-attached Intel servers. VANS adopts a modular design that can be easily modified to extend to other NVRAM architecture designs; it can also be attached to full-system simulators, such as gem51.

The CORDIC (COrdinated Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm provides a simplistic and accurate platform to compute various trigonometric, linear and non-linear functions using only shift-add operations. Due to inherently repetitive nature of DCT and CORDIC function, it yields to efficient hardware implementations. This paper presents the implementation of DCT and CORDIC on a novel configurable architecture ported onto a state of the art FPGA.

Experimental results show that under certain evaluation criteria, the proposed scheme is superior to the traditional whale algorithm in terms of health literacy prediction research accuracy and processing time of influencing factors, which has obvious advantages. Health literacy prediction research plays an extremely important role in the health of the elderly, which can accurately predict and optimize the growth characteristics and product generation of the elderly. However, the traditional whale algorithm has certain limitations in solving the problem of literacy prediction and simulation, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this paper, this paper proposes a health literacy prediction research scheme based on SMOTE algorithm and machine to better solve this problem. In this scheme, the influencing factors is accurately located through the data synthesis sampling theory, so as to determine the division of indicators, and the SMOTE algorithm and machine is used to construct the scheme. Experimental results show that under certain evaluation criteria, the accuracy and speed of the scheme is significantly improved for different problems, and it has better performance.

In most cases, the multiplications executed per unit time are used to estimate the performance of microcontrollers and digital signal processors. As a result, a more advanced multiplier architecture is being developed to boost system efficiency. The Vedic multiplier is a viable option. Its straightforward architecture and increased speed make it an unbeatable combination for completing complex multiplication calculations. These characteristics prove that the Vedic multiplier using hybrid logic implementation further reduces power consumption and increases speed, which is an essential limitation in embedded systems. In this work, we introduce a Vedic multiplier named ""Urdhva Tiryakbhayam"" which means ""vertical and horizontal"" multiplier and is realized by using a hybrid logic adder, which is the first of its kind. The multiplier can be used for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and other digital signal processing (DSP) applications, such as image processing, software-defined radio, and wireless communications. Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra is widely discussed in various search articles and proved the most effective method (algorithm), providing the smallest delay for multiplications of various sizes.

To minimize data movements for input matrices, outer product accelerators have been proposed. Since these accelerators access input matrices only once and then generate numerous partial products, managing the generated partial products is the key optimization factor. To reduce the number of partial products handled, the state-of-the-art accelerator uses software to tile an input matrix. However, the software-based tiling has three limitations. First, a user manually executes the tiling software and manages the tiles. Second, generating a compression format for each tile incurs memory-intensive operations. Third, an accelerator that uses the compression format cannot skip ineffectual accesses for input matrices.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes hardware-based pseudo-tiling (HARP), which enables logical tiling of the original compressed matrix without generating a compression format for each tile. To this end, HARP utilizes our proposed Run-time Operand Descriptor to point to an effectual column-row pair in a pseudo-tile. Consequently, HARP enables a user to use the accelerator as a normal SpGEMM operation does without tiling. Furthermore, HARP does not require a compression format for each tile and can skip ineffectual accesses for input matrices. To further improve the efficiency of pseudo-tiling, HARP performs super-tiling to combine pseudo-tiles and sub-tiling to further tile a pseudo-tile. Experiment results show that HARP achieves 4×, 35×, and 33× speedup and 5 , and× 664, and, 233× energy efficiency on average compared to the state-of-the-art outer product accelerator, CPU (MKL), and GPU (cuSPARSE), respectively.CCS CONCEPTS• Hardware → Emerging architectures; Hardware accelerators; • Computer systems organization → Architectures.","","979-8-3503-3056-4","","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411353","Sparse Matrix;Sparse matrix multiplication;SpGEMM;Spare matrix tiling;Tiling;Hardware accelerator;Application-specific hardware","Computer architecture;Organizations;Software;Energy efficiency;Sparse matrices;Research and development;Optimization","","","","75","","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The move towards this purpose is supported by government programs, development programs of regions and national economy sectors and a large number of other initiatives. Building a digital economy involves solving a number of problems, which have one common root cause - cardinal change of information communication technologies. In process of practical movement to new principles of management the contradiction between private and general approaches to their introduction becomes more acute. On the one hand, we can see financial growth of an increasing number of local tasks, the development of certain technologies, pilot projects and start-ups, and, on the other hand, insufficient attention to the development of an integrated systematic approach to the study of the digital economy as a holistic technological project that uses generalized information models and architecture. It's clear that without studying the properties of the digital economy as a large digital information system, it is impossible to form new markets and activity models in any of the application areas. The problem solved in the article is to resolve this contradiction. Goal of the work - the construction of an architectural model of a digital economy that unites the entire set of fundamental principles of its technological organization that are embodied in a set of digital technologies, the connections of technologies with each other and with the external environment. The following tasks are solved: the properties and attributes of the digital economy are analyzed,; precondition of the architectural description of the digital economy are identified,; a stratified architectural model of digital economy is developed. It is shown that the architectural model of the digital economy must contain infrastructure and subject-oriented levels. The first group includes physical laws and technologies for constructing real and virtual digital datal sources, networks and storing systems, data processing and distribution, as well as cloudy and foggy computing. The second - technologies for creating structures and data analysis, building digital platforms and applications, creating a digital platform ecosystem, digital markets and business processes models.

Its standardized signal bus architecture facilitates the seamless interconnection of various modules within a system, giving rise to the system-on-a-chip (SoC) design methodology. Despite the challenges associated with verifying on-chip bus protocols, this project successfully designs the AXI protocol using Verilog HDL, establishing a robust verification methodology with System Verilog (SV). The verification process attains success in validating the AMBAAXI Protocol, specifically in Write and Read Operations, incorporating an incremental burst feature.

Since the political turmoil in 1998, the country has been driving decentralization efforts, necessitating active participation from all provinces in energy management. These roles have gained critical importance due to the mounting pressure of energy transition and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the commitments made in The Paris Agreement of 2015. Despite these nationwide efforts, Papua Island, a region within Indonesia, has encountered challenges in crafting its province-specific energy planning documents, primarily attributed to limited data availability and a shortage of energy research expertise. The complexity has intensified following the expansion of the province from 2 to 5 regions in 2022. While awaiting streamlined bureaucratic arrangements, the demand projections and energy management from the Papua region remain essential for monitoring and evaluating Indonesia’s overall energy transition towards achieving the Net Zero Emission’s target by 2060. This research calculates the baseline for energy demands, a crucial element in facilitating the energy transition, based on historical data. To project energy demand until 2060, alongside historical data, economic targets, and population projections, various energy intervention policies have been applied. These interventions are categorized into two scenarios: business as usual and sustainable development. Utilizing the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) for simulation, the study demonstrates that with appropriate energy planning policies, Papua Island can actively contribute to meeting its regional energy demand without compromising the environmental impact in the future. The energy final demand projection in Papua is estimated to be 41,149 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (BOE).","","979-8-3503-1867-8","10.1109/ICHVEPS58902.2023.10257522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257522","Papua Island;Energy Demand Projection;LEAP;Energy Transition","Simulation;Green products;Sociology;Fossil fuels;Software;Planning;Energy management","","","","21","IEEE","26 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we target UAVs that feature a high number of degrees of freedom (DOF) and that are instrumented with a large number of sensors. For such platforms, we propose an architecture to perform data acquisition from on-board instrumentation at a frequency (100 Hz) that is twice as fast as existing products. Our architecture is capable of performing acquisition with strict timing constraints, thus, the produced data stream is suitable for performing real-time sensor fusion.

To meet these new challenges, this paper introduces a data-driven optimization of the production process by integrating a modular edge and cloud computing layer, and advanced data analysis. Defects are classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN) (predictive analytics) and corrected (depending on the defect type) by an automated rework (prescriptive analytics). The architecture of the CNN achieves an accuracy of 99.21% to predict the defect class. The automated rework process is selected through an implemented decision tree. The edge device communicates with a programmable logic controller (PLC) through a cyber physical interface. As an example of its practical application, the method is applied to hairpin welding of the stator of an electric motor with real production data.","","978-1-7281-6371-0","10.1109/COINS49042.2020.9191386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9191386","industry 4.0;cloud computing;edge computing;machine learning;convolutional neural networks;electric motors;hairpin;predictive analytics;prescriptive analytics;prescriptive automation","Welding;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Computer architecture;Stators;Real-time systems","","8","","16","IEEE","10 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a framework for a marketplace enhanced using linked open data (LOD) technology for linking software artifacts within projects as well as across software projects. The marketplace provides the infrastructure for collecting and aggregating software engineering data as well as developing services for mining, statistics, analytics and visualization of software data. Based on cross linking software artifacts and projects, the marketplace enables developers and users to understand the individual value of components and their relationship to bigger software systems.

There is a need to improve ETL performance for real-time applications. However, several scholarly and business investigations have been into the efficacy of data management dynamics and ETL technologies. As a result, it is essential to look at methods of increasing the effectiveness of ETL processes to meet the immediate demands of operations. This paper explores existing ETL systems' history, constraints, potential, and how machine learning models are integrated into ETL processes. However, as evidenced by a review of relevant academic literature, there is widespread support for using machine learning models to improve and perfect ETL applications.

In this study, we investigate how the shape and spacing of mesas or pads impact device capacitance through electrostatic field simulations, leveraging Maxwell's capacitance matrix and mutual capacitance matrix. Simulation analysis and experimental validation reveal that devices with circular Schottky contact electrode pads and minimal pad area exhibit lower capacitance values. Furthermore, we observe that the capacitance of the device initially decreases and then increases with the length of the air bridge. An optimal air bridge length exists that minimizes the capacitance of the device.

However, magnetic recording channels are generally modeled as binary-input intersymbol interference (ISI) channels, and the design of polar coding schemes for these channels remains an important open problem. Current magnetic hard disk drives use LDPC codes incorporated into a turbo-equalization (TE) architecture that combines a soft-output channel detector with a soft-input, soft-output sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder. An interleaved coding scheme with a multistage decoding (MSD) architecture with LDPC codes as component codes has been proposed as an alternative to TE for ISI channels. In this work, we investigate the use of polar codes as component codes in the TE and MSD architectures. It is shown that the achievable rate of the MSD scheme converges to the symmetric information rate of the ISI channel when the number of interleaves is large.

Consumers want to spend money on environmentally friendly products, but they are seldomly informed of the environmental contributions of the suppliers. Meanwhile, each supplier seeks to recover the costs for the environmental contributions to re-invest them into further contributions. Instead, in most current supply chains, the reward for each supplier is not clearly defined and fairly distributed. To address these issues, we propose a supply-chain contribution management platform for fair reward distribution called ‘Advanced Ledger.’ This platform records suppliers' environ-mental contribution trails, receives rewards from consumers in exchange for trail-backed fungible tokens, and fairly distributes the rewards to each supplier based on the contribution trails. In this paper, we overview the architecture of Advanced Ledger and 11 technical features, including decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) based contribution verification, contribution concealment, negative-valued tokens, fair reward distribution, atomic rewarding, and layer-2 rewarding. We then study the requirements and candidates of the smart contract platforms for implementing Advanced Ledger.

Compute-In-Memory (CIM) designs performing DNN computations within memory arrays are being explored to mitigate this `Memory Wall' bottleneck of latency and energy overheads. Among the incumbent embedded memories, the Static Access Random Memory (SRAM) built using high performance logic transistors and interconnects can enable custom CIM designs while offering low pJ/bit access energy, high-endurance, high-performance, and high-bandwidth. The wordline and bitline voltages and pulse-widths are modulated to realize analog or digital domain multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) computations using multiple SRAM bitcell variants. This paper describes the trends in recent CIM-SRAM designs utilizing such analog and digitally-intensive approaches. In an analog CIM-SRAM design, the inputs/activations are transformed into analog voltage or pulsewidth and applied on wordlines and/or bitlines. Multibit MAC computations often involve peripheral data converter circuits which need to be optimized significantly to minimize the area and energy overheads. On the other hand, digitally-intensive CIM-SRAM approaches try to avoid analog circuits by implementing smaller bit-width wordline/bitline computations and utilize sense amplifiers for performing basic logic operations and/or employ small digital logic block next to the SRAM column I/O circuits forming compute-in/near SRAM designs. Key design trends in both the approaches and qualitative comparisons are presented with a perspective on future CIM-SRAM designs.","","978-1-6654-1913-0","10.1109/AICAS51828.2021.9458576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458576","","Conferences;Neural networks;Memory management;Random access memory;Integrated circuit interconnections;Machine learning;Market research","","6","","21","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper implements DCT and its inverse (IDCT) on our proposed Mat-Core processor using scalar/vector/matrix instruction sets. Mat-Core extends a general-purpose scalar processor with a matrix unit for processing vector/matrix data. The extended matrix unit is decoupled into two components to hide memory latency: address generation and data computation, which communicate through data queues. The data computation unit is organized in parallel lanes, which can execute scalar-vector, vector-vector, scalar-matrix, vector-matrix, and matrix-matrix instructions. To show the scalability of Mat-Core architecture, the performance of DCT and IDCT are evaluated on Mat-Core with different number of parallel lanes (one, four, and eight lanes). A cycle accurate model of Mat-Core processor is implemented using SystemC (system level modeling language). Our results show performances of 1.5, 5, 6.4 and 14.4 FLOPs/cycle on Mat-Core with single lane and 8-element vector registers, four lanes and 4×4 matrix registers, four lanes and 8×4 matrix registers, and eight lanes and 8×8 matrix registers, respectively. The maximum performance of the Mat-Core processor on DCT and IDCT represents 90% of the ideal value. Moreover, increasing the number of parallel lanes from one to four and then to eight results in speeding up the execution of DCT and IDCT by factors of 4.2 and 9.5, respectively, which indicates the scalability of Mat-Core architecture.","","978-1-4244-7042-6","10.1109/ICCES.2010.5674882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5674882","DCT/IDCT;high performance computing;performance evaluation;scalable architecture;SystemC implementation;vector/matrix processing","Registers;Discrete cosine transforms;Matrices;Pipelines;Computer architecture;Performance evaluation;Clocks","","","","13","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The big volume of available information has helped aerospace companies to increase the reliability and availability of their products and to improve the safety of aircraft, flight crew and passengers. In the event of system failures, the high complexity of the new aircraft systems, combined with the large amount of data provided by them, make the management of risk assessments a more complex activity and make the decision- making process more accurate but challenging. This process may lead to excessive conservatism when evaluating risk levels, which may in turn impact operation costs and production costs; increase the flight crew’s workload due to possibility to add more work to their normal tasks to deal with systems failures; or, conversely, lead to an underestimation of the criticality of the risk, thus exposing aircraft occupants to an unacceptable level of risk.Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) makes it possible for input signals variables or condition indicators of different physical components to be combined and compared in multiple scenarios, in a process known as pattern recognition and interpretation of physical condition. This paper addresses the potential for machine learning and pattern generation and interpretation to support reliability and safety in the aerospace industry. It examines a set of three scenarios from industry practice: in the first two, Machine Learning (ML) is used as a supporting tool for reducing costs, and improving reliability and safety, respectively. In the final scenario, ML is embedded in the system architecture to highlight the challenges of the use of ML in association with the current design assurance levels for software and real-time risk assessment.

The traditional view of security solutions have focused on preventing external threats such as malware in the forms of viruses, hackers and worms through perimeter from penetrating the organizations system where solutions that include firewalls and antivirus software were the leading mitigating techniques. While still aware of outside threats, companies are now coming to understand they can no longer ignore inside violations concerning data at rest or data on the move in order to protect the organization's private and confidential information. So information security and privacy is quickly becoming critical whether it is internal or external. This paper investigates trust-enhancing approaches, articulating a strategy based on three main thrusts: developing secure software systems (confidence), executing software in a protected, controlled environment (control), and monitoring software for cyber threats (discovery).

SQL and relational databases have table forms, while NoSQL has a format of document-oriented stores. Integration issue came as a challenge when the two different databases were used on the same software. The challenge is increasingly complicated when the database used becomes the resource of online websites. In this study, we present a case which based on 2 online e-Commerce furniture websites that. These both online websites will merge their product data into 1 new database. This research combines two different databases using Web services to retrieve data in each database and a synchronization system for the process of checking and storing data into a new database. All merging components are stored on cloud storage services. Every batching process in the synchronization system is done online and automatically uses Cron. This research provides the results of data integration testing on web services and measurement of the synchronization system execution time. After testing 2 web services used, all passed the data integration test. Then measurements are made on the synchronization system by looking at the displayed execution time. The results of measurements using 100 to 1000 data and different conditions, the execution time obtained from 4 to 5 seconds for each data in the measurement increases to 500 data. The results of this study indicate that the integration of data from 2 different databases using web services and synchronization systems is tolerable and suitable for the amount of data under 10000 data with the condition of the database already filled.","","978-1-7281-8247-6","10.1109/IC2IE50715.2020.9274613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274613","database;nosql;sql;relational database;cron;synchronization system;combines two different databases","Databases;Synchronization;Computer architecture;NoSQL databases;Structured Query Language;Testing;Service-oriented architecture","","2","","40","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure proper temperature control and monitoring during transportation, the certification of data is essential. Traditional methods for data management, like paper-based records and manual processes, can be unreliable and cause errors, leading to potential food waste. The integration of Internet of Things and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) presents a promising solution for the challenges in cold chain management and can help to improve the overall efficiency of the process. Internet of Things devices can gather and transmit sensor data in real-time, while DLT can ensure the authenticity and immutability of the data. The combination of these technologies can offer a transparent and reliable solution for cold chain management, improving the safety and quality of perishable goods during transportation. Additionally, DLT eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling direct exchange of data between stakeholders, leading to greater efficiency and accountability. In this paper, we propose a system architecture focused on the cold chain management in transportation that integrates Internet of Things and DLT.

The automated test generation techniques in the literature do not always produce effective and compilable test cases. A test generation framework is proposed in this paper which uses the information extracted from UML diagrams and source code. The three layer architecture of the framework is responsible for this generation task. The first layer processes the user inputs i.e the UMLs as XMLs and the source code as source classes, which are used by the second layer. This layer identifies the application semantic from XMLs and extracts syntax from source. It combines this extracted information together and generates unit and integration test cases. This incorporation of syntax and semantics should make the generated tests less erroneous as it creates a better understanding of the application before the test construction. These two directional information collection should also mitigate the negative effects of inconsistent UMLs or source code on the test suites. Moreover, the generation of both unit and integration test case may increase the test coverage. A case study, conducted on a sample Java project, assessed the framework competence and has been successful to construct test scripts.","","978-1-4799-6288-4","10.1109/ICCITechn.2014.7073069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073069","software testing;automatic test generation;unit testing;integration testing","Syntactics;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Software;XML;Data mining;Testing","","1","2","16","IEEE","2 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Organizations and developers typically aim to adhere to a specified system architecture to avoid certain dependencies between multi-lingual components. However, such dependencies may still be introduced and only resolved later on. Thus, we refer to them as unintended dependencies: dependencies that may exist, but are not wanted by the developers or organization. There has been little research on multi-lingual systems so far, and dependencies within such systems have not been studied explicitly. With this paper, we tackle this issue by contributing a cat-alog of unintended software dependencies in multi-lingual systems. We elicited it by interviewing 17 practitioners at ASML. We report eight types of unintended dependencies, their causes, the resulting problems, and how they can be resolved. Further, we connect our findings to research on software smells and dependencies in mono-lingual systems. Our contributions serve as recommendations for practitioners on how to deal with unintended dependencies, as supportive evidence for existing research, and as basis for new techniques for managing dependencies in (multi-lingual) systems.","2832-7659","979-8-4007-0501-4","10.1145/3639477.3639725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10554728","Dependencies;Software Architecture;Multi-Lingual Systems;Software Quality;Software Maintenance","Computer languages;Systems architecture;Organizations;Software systems;Maintenance;Complexity theory;Software engineering","","","","47","CCBY","18 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, ML engineers need guidance on how to mitigate potential shortcomings in order to fix bugs or improve the system’s performance. We propose a documentation artifact that aims to provide such guidance in a prescriptive way. Our proposal, called Method Cards, aims to increase the transparency and reproducibility of ML systems by allowing stakeholders to reproduce the models, understand the rationale behind their designs, and introduce adaptations in an informed way. We showcase our proposal with an example in small object detection, and demonstrate how Method Cards can communicate key considerations that help increase the transparency and reproducibility of the detection model.

Neural network models that can accurately detect biofilm images having corrosion products are likely to have significant and broad implications in the study and development of materials. However, generating and annotating biofilm image datasets in sufficient volumes is a major impediment in developing such networks. A self-supervised learning approach is presented for automatically detecting MIC products on metal surfaces based on analyses of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) biofilm images. The proposed approach uses a Simple Siamese (SimSiam) architecture to learn visual image representations from an unlabeled set of biofilm images, which is then fine-tuned using a scarce set of labeled images to build a model to detect biofilms containing corrosion products. The architecture generates two different augmented versions of the input images and learns the representations using an encoder that uses ResNet backbone. The architecture aims to minimize the negative cosine similarity of the outputs from the encoders and hence learns the representations of the images as both augmented versions belong to the same image. In order to improve the dataset quality and volume, input images are contrast enhanced, scaled, and overlapping image patches are generated and used to learn representations and fine-tuning. The performance of the models are analyzed using precision and recall metrics for patches of varying sizes. An overall accuracy of 62% was obtained for the classification of corrosion in the images after finetuning the model with scarce labeled dataset. Our results show that the models built using the proposed self-supervised learning approach can successfully detect corrosion products in biofilm images and that the performance of the models successively improves with increase in the patch size.","","978-1-6654-0126-5","10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669343","self-supervised learning;biofilms;corrosion","Measurement;Scanning electron microscopy;Microwave integrated circuits;Visualization;Materials science and technology;Corrosion;Biological system modeling","","6","","12","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a little study in assessing energy requirements of baseband functions of base station (e-nodeb) due to its energy consumption contribution is significantly low when compared to other more energy hungry components such as power amplifiers, analog frontend and protocols.

Data dependences make GPUs struggle, while CPUs and prior sparse linear algebra accelerators also suffer from low compute throughput.We present Spatula, an architecture for accelerating sparse matrix factorization algorithms. Spatula hardware combines systolic processing elements that execute structured tasks at high throughput with a flexible scheduler that handles challenging data dependences. Spatula enables a novel scheduling algorithm that avoids stalls and load imbalance while reducing data movement, achieving high compute utilization.

In this work, we address these limitations by proposing novel attention-based approaches. We first propose a local and global context attention (LGCA) model, which constructs the context representations of a document as a combination of global and local contexts. The local context is used to capture local document-specific information. Furthermore, a multi-context attention (MCA) model is proposed to capture multiple local contexts within a document, thereby fusing the overall semantic information of documents. We conduct experiments on document-level sentiment classification tasks where extra user and product information is shown to be important.

Experiments with two types of SSDs both based on DiskSim with SSD Extension show that the analytic model approach can dynamically adjust data distribution as workloads evolve to enhance performance or lifetime.","2160-1968","978-1-4799-0218-7","10.1109/MSST.2013.6558425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558425","","Analytical models;Ash;Data models;Time factors;Flash memories;Educational institutions;Performance evaluation","","5","1","8","IEEE","15 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep networks have seen productive alterations in recent years, and the usage of health wearables has become more prevalent The Internet of Things, which was made possible by deep neural networks, resulted in innovative social breakthroughs in medicine and opened up new avenues for the investigation of healthcare data. Despite the progress that has been made, there are still a few issues that need to be resolved in terms of the quality of the service. The Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network, or GFB- CNN, is a method of smart healthcare that is powered by Deep Neural Networks and takes the use of real-time data This technique is presented here as part of this study. In this paper, we proposed an all-encompassing Al-driven Internet of Things (IoT) eHealth architecture that makes use of an ICNN in order to increase accuracy and efficiency across the essential quality of service parameters. An extensive Mobile HEALTH (MHEALTH) dataset is analyzed in order to determine how effective the approach is in its intended use. This illustrative example investigates and covers all of the pertinent aspects of the recommended technique, from design concepts to matching accuracy, overhead costs, and the amount of time associated with state-of-the-art procedures. The ICNN strategy was evaluated in a variety of simulated environments alongside other approaches that are considered to be state of the art We show that our method effectively analyses health information investigations for cardiac indications by being able to differentiate between healthy and abnormal heart signals in an efficient manner at a cheap cost and in a short amount of time, both of which are necessary for sensing and data collection.","","978-1-6654-9790-9","10.1109/MysuruCon55714.2022.9972597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9972597","healthcare;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);Convolution Neural Network;Grey Filter","Deep learning;Cloud computing;Technological innovation;Costs;Wearable computers;Neural networks;Bayes methods","","1","","21","IEEE","13 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Early Performance Estimation for Industrial Component-Based Design of Reliable Software Defined Radio System","R. Henia; L. Rioux; N. Sordon; T. Vergnaud",THALES; THALES; THALES; THALES,2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops,"10 Jan 2013","2012","","","45","46","The growing complexity of software applications, combined with increasing reliability requirements and constant quality and time-to-market constraints, creates new challenges for performance engineering practices in the area of real-time embedded systems. It is namely expected that delivered products combine timing garantees with fault tolerant behavior, e.g. by switching to fault tolerant modes in case of errors, while respecting strict real-time requirements. When developing such real-time systems according to a traditional application of the ""Va""-cycle, performance verification and validation activities start only when development and integration are completed. As a consequence, performance issues are detected at a late stage. At this time, they are more difficult and expensive to fix. At Thales, we have therefore focused on the automation of performance engineering activities and their application as early as possible in the industrial design process of reliable Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems, as a mean to shorten the design time and reduce risks of timing failures. The SDR particularity consists in implementing the signal modulation of a communication radio using software rather than hardware. It is namely much easier to reprogram the modulation carrier in order to fit different situations with the same hardware radio (e.g. each national army typically uses specific waveforms to guarantee the confidentiality of communications). The implementation of a reliable software waveform can be a difficult task, as it involves real-time constraints as well as embedded aspects while dealing with complex algorithms including those for fault recovery. Thales created a software framework family, named MyCCM (Make your Component Container Model), to support the implementation of such real-time embedded software. MyCCM is a tailorable component based design approach that takes inspiration from the Lightweight Component Container Model (LwCCM) defined by the OMG. It implements the concept of functional components that encapsulate algorithms. The components correspond to passive code controlled by an underlying runtime, and are connected through communication ports to create a complete application. This allows the construction of applications by assembling independent functional components. It also enforces the separation of concerns between the functional aspects described by component ports and the non functional elements that stay outside the components (message chaining across the whole component architecture, FIFO sizes, task priorities, communications mechanisms, execution times, etc). MyCCM models can be designed either using Thales internal modeling tools or using UML modelers with plain UML. Our developed framework for the early performance estimation of SDR MyCCM models is represented in the figure below. The first step consists in extending the SDR MyCCM model with performance properties, i.e. timing and behavior characteristics of the application (e.g. execution times and activation frequencies for threads and methods, data dependencies and communication protocols between threads) and execution characteristics of the hardware platform (e.g. speed, scheduling policy, etc). The OMG standard MARTE is key language for this purpose. However, due to the complexity of its syntax, it may result in very complex and confusing diagrams and models. We have therefore adapted the MARTE syntax based on the Thales SDR designers' feedback, thus allowing representing the performance properties in an easier and much more intuitive manner. We have opted for scheduling analysis techniques for the performance estimation of the extended MyCCM models, which is the next step in our framework. These techniques are well adapted for this purpose, since they rely on an abstraction of the timing relevant characteristics and behaviors. From these characteristics, the scheduling analysis systematically derives worst-case scheduling scenarios, and timing equations safely bound the worst-case response times. However, we faced the problem that scheduling analysis is not directly applicable to extended MyCCM models due to the semantic mismatch between the later and the variety of scheduling analysis models known from the classical real time systems research and from the industrial scheduling analysis tools. In order to fill this semantic gap and to ensure a minimum of independence from modeling and scheduling analysis tools, we have decided to introduce a pivot scheduling analysis model in-between. For this purpose, we have specified and implemented a set of rules transforming extended SDR MyCCM models into equivalent pivot scheduling analysis models and the later into the selected scheduling analysis tool models to which a dedicated SDR MyCCM scheduling analysis is applicable. Finally, we have defined and implemented rules adapting the scheduling analysis results to the original SDR MyCCM model.","","978-1-4673-5048-8","10.1109/ISSREW.2012.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405415","reliable software defined radio systems;real-time software design;component-based modeling;scheduling analysis;MARTE","Unified modeling language;Job shop scheduling;Analytical models;Real-time systems;Adaptation models;Timing;Software reliability","","","","","IEEE","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy, IMAH in short, is used in 7 layers starting from homotopy, then type, and ending with presentation. Big data is in cyber worlds that are being formed in cyberspaces as computational spaces. Now cyberspaces are rapidly expanding on the Web either intentionally or spontaneously, with or without design. It is quite different in its emphasis of homotopy type theory as recently reported with emphasis on mathematical proof automation and computer verification. Widespread and intensive local activities are melting each other on the web as big data globally to create cyber worlds. The major key players of big data in cyber worlds include e-finance that trades a GDP-equivalent a day and e-manufacturing that is transforming industrial production into Web shopping of product components and assembly factories. Lacking proper theory and design, big data has continued to grow chaotic and are now out of human understanding and control. This research first presents a generic theoretical framework as an incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy, based on homotopy type theory, provides an axiomatic approach to theorize the potentials of big data in cyber worlds, and shows that the incrementally modular abstraction hierarchy automate big data application development and eliminates the need for design verification and validation.

This poses a market entry barrier for startups and small/medium enterprises, whose numbers have grown, especially in the areas of electrical aviation as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) systems.The process-oriented build tool presented in this paper is aiming to address this problem by providing an exemplary toolchain setup for a DO-331 compliant software development process. Based on MathWorks' MATLAB and Simulink products, the tool provides a development environment with predefined model templates, block libraries, and configuration settings as well as jobs for executing process-relevant tasks, like automatic code generation or static model analysis. By doing so, the tool ensures consistency of model artifacts created by developers across teams and also compatibility with downstream tools used for verification and validation on model and code level. Artifacts from each process step are stored within the tool so that full bidirectional traceability can be ensured.While the tool has been used in the development of flight control applications in the past, its capabilities are currently improved based on lessons learned from these projects and furthermore, extended to new use-cases.This paper will discuss two tool improvements: handling of dependencies of distributed software modules and tool artifact ownership, which are made to handle complex software-development project consisting of multiple software components developed by a distributed team.

Consultants; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University,2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),"22 Nov 2021","2021","","","1","7","Summary & ConclusionsDisruptive events from field returns are difficult to analyze at best and can result in a ""no problem found"" (NPF) classification. The percentage of NPF is very high, ranging from 40% to 70% of customer returned products [1]–[3]. The difficulty is further compounded when the customers' environment cannot be reproduced at the manufacturer diagnostics testing facility, whereby uncharacterized NPF results in incomplete information and risks in future product designs.The analytics framework assists in looking for areas that would lead the reliability engineer to the issue of component vulnerability, which should minimize the complex process of elimination. A methodology of correlations and query lookups will be much faster compared to iterative supplier interactions, which could take weeks. The framework is not going to solve the problem. The knowledge base and big data can collate information, with the intent of cutting time, by pinpointing areas that would prioritize the diagnosis path, rather than solve every possible scenario.Applying analytics for customer returns works best when problems can be found but leaves ""no problem found"" as unidentified with no ability to diagnose, predict and prescribe as shown in Fig. 1. In order to address the unidentified analytics, we must correlate components with other known products, customer usage, and supplier provided information. This methodology requires the big data approach in order to capture as much data as possible from the manufacturer, supplier, and customer environments. Correlation, pattern discovery, and trends are built on using machine learning techniques. The value in big data and machine learning is the speed in which the reliability engineer can correlate this data.This framework integrates several modeling approaches which addresses the unidentified areas due to NPF. These approaches combines business analytics process, big data, bio-inspired behavioral modelling and machine learning artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques to discover new relationships. Big data typically means more data is better. Traditionally, the manufacturer only tracked component data on the board in order to analyze NPFs from customer returns.A knowledge base allows for integration of existing big data information from various environments relating to the board. These sources of information cover the scope from supplier, manufacturer and customer. NPF returns are tracked using bio-inspired behavioral models. The business analytics allows manufacturers to be proactive and predictive for NPF. Self-organized maps are used as an ML/AI technique to discover new relationships.In conclusion, the business analytics framework and architecture is improved by a bio-inspired model which allows business analytics to become proactive and predictive. The big data methodology allows us to expand the parameters for the supplier, manufacturer and customer in order to make better decisions.

Conventional approaches for PN suppression suffer from high computational complexity. To overcome this, we present a low-complexity fully-digital PN suppression for mmWave systems. The key ideas are to exploit the coherence bandwidth of a mmWave system and an approximation of the PN spectrum, based on its Np dominant components. Utilizing these features, the joint estimation problem of PN and channel can be reformulated into a system with the same number of equations and unknowns, which enables low-complexity PN suppression by using a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce the hardware cost of the LMMSE estimator by using a B-bit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantization, which has a very low complexity of O(Np2 + NNp), where N is the number of subcarriers in an OFDM symbol. As a proof-of-concept, a low-cost VLSI architecture is presented to realize the proposed method. The proposed architecture in 28 nm CMOS (post-synthesis) results in an area cost of 258 K gate count and power consumption of 19.3 mW at 250 MHz clock rate.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180784","","Signal to noise ratio;OFDM;Channel estimation;Estimation;Quantization (signal);Coherence;Frequency-domain analysis","","3","","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Data Integration at Scale: From Relational Data Integration to Information Ecosystems","M. L. Brodie","Verizon Communications, Inc., USA",2010 24th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications,"1 Jun 2010","2010","","","2","3","Our world is increasingly data-driven. The growth and value of data continue to exceed all predictions. Potential for business opportunity, economic growth, scientific discovery, and even national security lie hidden in the vast and growing data collections distributed across our Digital Universe. Harvesting the value of data requires finding, integrating, and analyzing data distributed across our Digital Universe. Failing to integrate data could be as mild as losing business through a lack of an integrated view of relevant business opportunities and threats or as serious as not anticipating the most serious terrorist attack on America through an inability to integrate relevant information distributed across 17 US intelligence agencies and 28 intelligence databases. Due to data being distributed across both entities and data repositories, data integration has become perhaps the most important data operation but certainly the most costly accounting for up to 40% of data processing budgets. Data integration requirements are growing dramatically due to astounding growth in semantics (i.e., increasingly sophisticated application and data modeling requirements) and scale (i.e., web-scale data and transaction types, volumes, and distribution). Since the mid-1980's the Relational Data Model has been the bedrock of business data processing providing a simple, elegant, and powerful basis for storing, finding, and integrating data based on simplifying assumptions. First, business data is naturally tabular; second, tabular business data follows relational principles; and third, assuming that there is a single source of truth, data views can be integrated into a single view under a global schema and that views of the same information are mutually consistent. To the extent that application data and operations fit naturally and meaningfully into the relational model and follow the three assumptions, Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) provide the most efficient and cost effective data integration solution on the planet and will continue to do so through hardware and engineering advances. As semantic and scale requirements of business data grew in the 1990's relational integration had to be extended ideally internal to the relational database engine, otherwise externally in data integration tools. This led to a plethora of data integration tools and supporting infrastructures with sales exceeding $3.3 billion in 2009 with an expected annual grow rate of 8%. These integration solutions are typically less efficient than relational integration and considerably more costly to acquire and more complex to deploy, yet respond to genuine, if esoteric, data integration requirements. While relational integration in RDBMSs augmented by integration tools meet the requirements of many large-scale applications, they are increasingly less applicable to a growing class of very-large-scale Information Ecosystems that can involve thousands of information systems and databases. Most Fortune 500 companies have ten or more major organizations Corporate Management, Sales, Marketing, Engineering, Product Development, etc. each requiring it's own view of the enterprise from it's unique perspective. Such views are often derived (i.e., integrated) from 5,000-10,000 databases. The Information Ecosystem is the information systems, databases, workflows, people, and infrastructure required to build, maintain, and dynamically update (i.e., integrate) the myriad organizational views. While the relational model and some combination of the three simplifying assumptions may apply to each component information system or database, the Information Ecosystem does not. While an individual information system may be designed to simplify the semantics of the real world application that it represents, the complexity of the real world or of the interactions between 1,000's of information systems cannot be as readily simplified. That is, relational integration and integration tools may apply to an individual or to a small number of information systems, but they are less applicable to large numbers of information systems such as occur in Information Ecosystems. Relational technology is one of the most successful computing technologies in history based in part on the elegance, simplicity, and power of the Relational Data Model. It established a prototype for the next thirty years of database developments. Until the .comand Web-fuelled expansion of our Digital Universe, the majority of data intensive applications were built on the bedrock of relational technology. Applications that did not fit or could not be forced into relational databases were built as extensions to relational technology or as entirely separate solutions. Both methods were not successful such as the rise and fall of objectoriented databases. It now appears that the Relational Data Universe is less than 15% of the Digital Universe. Yet harvesting the value of data in our Digital Universe still requires finding, integrating, and analyzing data distributed across the Digital Universe. If relational integration applies to less than 15%, what data integration solutions are required for the other 85%? The rapid expansion of our Digital Universe both by amazing applications spawned by the Web and by phenomenal advances in hardware speeds and costs led to a continuous stream of semantic and scale requirements that far outpaced data integration solutions and has spawned or been spawned by new technologies such as Web search, Collaborative Filtering, MapReduce, the Semantic Web, Ontologies, Cloud computing, and a dizzying array of others. This talk surveys the evolution of data integration requirements and solutions from the Relational Data Universe to the Digital Universe. It examines data integration solutions in the Relational Data Universe starting with the relational data model and the three simplifying assumptions. It considers the major advances in data integration solutions in terms of semantics; database engine capabilities including data format, data architecture, and data governance; and the integration methods of integration tools. We consider a very-large-scale Information Ecosystem to illustrate limits of data integration solutions in the Relational Data Universe and conclude with review of directions towards data integration beyond the Relational Data Universe including new data models, a profound new direction from the Database Community; Information Ecosystems; Semantic Technologies emerging from the Semantic Web community; and Cloud computing where data integration may reside as Integration-as-a-Service or Informationas-a-Service (IaaS either way!).","2332-5658","978-1-4244-6696-2","10.1109/AINA.2010.184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474665","","Ecosystems;Relational databases;Information systems;Deductive databases;Data processing;Engineering management;Marketing and sales;Management information systems;Power generation economics;Economic forecasting","","12","","","IEEE","1 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rationale behind this fusion is that different sources can complement each other since they have different natures, formats, and origins. Although emotional information expressed in users' comments on the Web is in accordance with the emotional audio-visual content of videos, they are not synchronized. In order to address this problem, decision-level fusion is needed when such asynchronous modalities should be fused. In this article, a new decision-level fusion approach based on Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators is proposed. In this approach, emotion is first detected based on the audio, video, and users' comments and then, individual decisions are fused using the OWA method. The proposed method is evaluated on the music videos of the standard DEAP data set. The results of comparing the proposed method with average, product, sum, and Dempster-Shafer fusion methods show that the proposed OWA-based method outperforms other methods in different fusion settings.","","978-1-7281-1431-6","10.1109/ICWR.2019.8765263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765263","Social Networks;User’s Comments;Data Fusion;Ordered Weighted Averaging","Feature extraction;Visualization;Emotion recognition;Open wireless architecture;Social networking (online);Data integration;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","","3","","27","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By making this simple but critical modification, we achieve a dramatic speedup for the 4-bit PQ on an ARM architecture.

This trend brings great opportunities for manufacturing companies, but also inherits challenges to overcome. Resulting from this, a heterogeneous tool-landscape has emerged, where each of the single tools is addressing a particular aspect of the value-creation network. An example for such a tool specifically targeting the engineering of such flexible production systems according to the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been proposed with the RAMI Toolbox. However, as universal frameworks are too general to deal with all aspects of developing such complex systems, other possibilities for conflictfree engineering of the system need to be available. Thus, the main contribution of this paper deals with proposing a Round-trip Engineering (RTE) approach, that allows to export previously modeled flexible production systems according to the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0 and subsequently reload external elaborated results. Thereby, a major benefit is the application of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), which ensures the traceability to the remaining system components. The chosen methodology for bidirectionally exchanging the engineering data is AutomationML, which allows to store exported information from RAMI 4.0 or import such stored information into it. The RTE-approach is thereby evaluated with a real-world case study, the Siemens Fischertechnik industrial plant model.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921425","Siemens; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921425","Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);AutomationML;Round-trip Engineering (RTE)","Industries;Production systems;Three-dimensional printing;Market research;Manufacturing;Industrial plants;Internet of Things","","1","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the ongoing evolution of land vehicles and machinery such as tractors and implements from mainly electro-mechanical devices towards software-driven and interconnected processing units enabling highly automated applications like smart farming. In particular, the underlying communication infrastructure of the involved distributed subsystems is subject to high demands in view of functional but also quality aspects like security and safety. And, testing the countless component interactions against associated criteria is not feasible without sophisticated techniques and tooling support, which continuous engineering solutions tackle with experimental evidence based on virtual evaluation environments. While these facilitate advanced practices for handling system complexity, formal verification of specific system properties remains a complementary and effective part of modern product development. In this paper, we present a generic methodical concept which combines virtual experimentation with formal analysis to substantiate decisions regarding the design and implementation of dependable CPS. We validate our approach by means of a case study on a common evaluation problem with regard to weighing up competing dependability attributes in the context of resource-constraint communication. To this end, we instantiate a virtual testbed based on the established VCIP reference architecture and FERAL simulation framework and we conduct empirical trials using systematic fault-injection combined with analytical proofing in terms of a trade-off evaluation. Specifically, we generate different CAN data frame variants during back-to-back tests for assessing the impact of cyclic redundancy checks and message authentication codes on the level of functional safety and security, respectively. The results show the general viability of our approach in conjunction with the capabilities of the evaluation platform for the continuous verification and validation of quality-related characteristics of a CPS under development.","2325-6664","979-8-3503-9572-3","10.1109/DSN-W60302.2024.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646957","Virtual Verification and Validation;Continuous Engineering;Simulation-based Testing;Trade-off Analysis;Evaluation Platform;VCIP/FERAL;Cyber-Physical Systems;Dependability Attributes;Functional Safety;Security","Smart agriculture;Systematics;Mission critical systems;Cyber-physical systems;Land vehicles;Safety;Security","","","","13","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite advancements, these systems still face a number of challenges, particularly when it comes to assisting the elderly; for example, smart supervision and feedback, intelligent monitoring, and facilitating future medical services. Further, these systems cannot provide continuous personalized HMS to the elderly throughout their lives. A framework based on Digital Twin (DT) technology is introduced to address these issues.

One effective strategy for safeguarding hardware components against these attacks involves the implementation of masking schemes. Among these schemes, Inner Product Masking (IPM) has received considerable attention and analysis in prior research. Inner Product Masking with Error Detection aims to extend the security provided by IPM to Fault-Injection attacks. This can be achieved by incorporating (linear) repetition code for fault detection (IPM-FD) or by integrating a non-linear robust error detection into the scheme (IPM-RED). IPM-RED can detect (with non-zero probability) every fault regardless the number of bits it flips. However, this robustness comes with a cost, a non-linear function may leak via the physical channels more information than a linear one. This paper shows that information leakage from IPM-RED is marginal.

To address the influence maximization problem on a massive scale, we design distributed algorithms via a cluster of machines, which can effectively speed up the computation while maintaining the state-of-the-art (1 -1/e-c)-approximation guarantee.

"Efficient optical interconnect architecture for HPC and data center systems","H. Schwetman",Oracle Labs,2015 IEEE Optical Interconnects Conference (OI),"1 Jun 2015","2015","","","2","3","Summary form only given. Modern large-scale computer systems require interconnection networks that are both high-performance and energy efficient. Most large-scale systems are made from a large number of “nodes”, where each node has one or more computing elements and a block of main memory, and is connected to a network that interconnects all of the nodes. There are several factors influencing the evolution of systems that has lead to this configuration: (1) as these components are all based on consumer products, the costs have become very low, as compared to customized components, (2) many problems require very large amounts of main memory (for efficient execution), and the best way to have sufficient memory capacity is to use many smaller discrete blocks of memory, as opposed to one or a few large blocks of memory, and (3) this arrangement of distributed nodes offers opportunities for maximum levels of parallel computation. The Top500 list [Top500] lists high-performance computer (HPC) systems ranked by achieved performance on a standard benchmark program. On this list, the number of nodes per system ranges from 44 to 98,000. Provisioning an efficient, high-performance network interconnecting these nodes is critical for the effective operation of such a system. Also, the ""Exascale Report"" [Kogg08] highlights the impacts of network power requirements in a ""strawman"" execscale system design. In this design, the interconnect portion of the proposed system consumes 27% of the total projected system power. In multi-node systems, there are two classes of interconnection networks: an intra-node network connecting the sockets and cores on a single node, and an inter-node network connecting the tens to thousands of nodes that comprise the system. The Oracle macrochip [Krish09] is a design for a node that uses a Silicon Photonics intra-node network to connect the 64 sites on a node. The next step in exploiting this macrochip is a system based on interconnecting multiple macrochips. Both this intranode network and the proposed inter-node network use optical communication to achieve the energy-efficient, high-performance operation that will be required in future HPC systems. This talk summarizes some of the lessons learned in designing and analyzing the macrochip [Koka12] ; it also discusses some of the issues that are emerging in the design of the multi-macrochip systems of the future.","2376-8665","978-1-4799-8179-3","10.1109/OIC.2015.7115659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7115659","","","","","","4","IEEE","1 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantages of using previously developed software in new projects are easily understood. However, reusing artifacts is usually done in an ad-hoc and incipient way, requiring an important effort of adaptation, so developers frequently prefer to develop components from scratch. In this paper we present a strategy that is being adopted by Critical Software, a medium-sized company, to promote software reuse. This strategy starts by assuming that the success of software reuse is dependent on the ability of measuring its advantages. We have thus proposed the use of the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) technique, extended with Data Warehousing data model design concepts to extract a set of reuse-specific metrics for measuring the gains of reuse. We show that it is very easy to measure the productivity improvement due to code reuse, by simply measuring or estimating the efforts of developing a component for reuse, integrating it a new artifact, and developing this artifact, built with reusing the component.","1550-6215","978-1-4673-0245-6","10.1109/SEW.2011.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146916","software reuse;metrics;GQM;Data Warehousing","Software;Productivity;Warehousing;Complexity theory;Software metrics","","3","7","9","IEEE","9 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this challenge, a concept of feature oriented software development (FOSD) is introduced. That way, the software system will be delivered as a set of features and the feature set could be decoupled at any time, according to the latest set of requirements without harming to any existing functionality. In this research the final outcome has been a feature oriented domain specific language (DSL). The objective of this developed feature oriented DSL is to make it effective even for business analysts to introduce new features without getting help from the development team of the project.

However, the current implementation of production cloud simulation in discrete manufacturing workshops has reduced the timeliness of workshop production simulation due to the cumbersome model construction and application of a large number of heterogeneous devices, as well as the latency problem caused by the large amount of simulation calculations and data, which has limited the further application of workshop cloud simulation services, and led to the difficulty of assessing and predicting the workshop production state online based on cloud simulation. Aiming at the above difficulties, an online workshop production state simulation method based on cloud-client collaboration is proposed. Firstly, a unified componentized model of equipment is constructed based on multi-dimensional information, which improves the speed of model construction and service generalization, and secondly, a collaborative simulation operation mechanism is proposed, which decouples the system-level simulation from the component-level simulation and puts it into the server-side and the client-side operation respectively, and improves the efficiency of real-time multi-granularity simulation of the production progress of the discrete workshop by combining event-driven and data-driven methods. Finally, an online simulation platform for discrete shop production is designed and developed, and the method is verified by examples, which reduces the volume of network transmission data by 19.4% for a single simulation.","","979-8-3503-6088-2","10.1109/ICAC61394.2024.10718783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10718783","Cloud simulation;Modeling & Simulation;Collaborative simulation;Progress evaluation","Cloud computing;Conferences;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Production;Data models;Manufacturing;Service-oriented architecture;Synchronization;Servers","","","","21","IEEE","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Datacenters powered with renewable energy have been proposed. But because of the intermittency of these power alternatives, these platforms remains connected to the classical power grid. IT structure and electrical constraints were often questioned separately, leading to a non-efficient global system. In this paper, an energy self-sufficient green datacenter is modeled and designed, by proposing an electrically autonomous infrastructure including wind turbines, solar panels and its own short and long-term storage devices mainly based on batteries and hydrogen system. Existing sizing approaches limit themselves to a perfect QoS leading to an overestimation of the needed equipment. In this paper we show how to reduce and combat this overprovioning by questioning its impact on the QoS and needed equipment: decreasing the number of computing or storage elements (servers and batteries). As an example, decreasing the targeted QoS from 100 to 95% more than halves the needed number of servers, while a decrease of 30% of the battery capacity has a negligible impact on the electrical infrastructure.","","978-1-6654-5157-4","10.1109/SBAC-PADW56527.2022.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978502","Green Datacenter;Sizing reduction;Scheduling;Renewable energy;Quality of Service","Costs;Hydrogen;Green products;Quality of service;Batteries;Wind turbines;Servers","","","","18","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this procedure, we realized the system designers have to work on many repeated jobs in different BASN systems. Even worse, changing one component of the system usually requires designers to rewrite a large portion of code. In this paper, we present a Smart Phone Assisted Real-Time heAlth care Network framework (SPARTAN), to simplify the development procedure and extend the flexibility of BASN systems. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SPARTAN, we implement a smartphone assisted stressor examination and warning system.

This shall ensure the quality and long-term performance of the product. However, the challenge is that the experimental reliability test during manufacturing is quite time-consuming and cost-consuming, and finding a new method to accelerate the test itself is very difficult. Currently, virtual performance predictors such as the finite element method (FEM) form a key for assessing the criticality of a PCBA product, but they are still limited due to their costly computational power if the problem is geometrically complex or difficult to handle, as electronic devices become more compact and sophisticated. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, novel modelling techniques involving machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have gained extensive attention from engineers and this is especially the case in the field of electronic system reliability. By building an appropriate surrogate model, designers need to input only the component geometry of the newly designed electronic product to immediately obtain a lifetime estimation of the specific product. The given work reviews the state-of-the-art surrogate model-based approaches used in electronic systems, specifically in the field of PCBA.

However, in safety domains (e.g., avionic, railway) it is mandatory to be compliant with a safety standard (e.g., D0178B), this means that evidence on the software life cycle of the software components, and therefore also of the OS, should be available. Those evidences that represent the certification package of the OS might not be available for commercial or Open Source OSs, hence their certification requires a complementary creation of evidence to serve as certification inputs. The certification process is costly, thus the system integrator must carefully select the candidate OS. Hence, it would be of great value to support the system integrator in selecting the more suitable OS to certify. In this position paper, we introduce our future research on the development of a Precertification kit (PK), that is, a framework that supports the evaluation of OS in what concerns certification requirements.

At the same time, network protocols are going to evolve in order to carry energy-aware information, and to add them to classical performance indexes in network optimisation strategies. However, the question of how to map energy-aware indexes, often arising from low-level local hardware details, and the ones related to network performance is still an open issue. Starting from these considerations, we propose the Green Abstraction Layer (GAL), a device internal interface that provides a standard way of accessing and organising energy-aware information from the low-level hardware components to control processes.

However, the diversity in data in terms of source, velocity and volume demand to exploit powerful and adaptive analysis techniques aimed at extracting information for supporting software and requirements engineering decisions as well. For instance, automated elicitation of the requirements has been investigated in conjunction with multi-criteria, which may take into account the different perspective of stakeholders. Whereas other factors like similar applications with the presence of user feedback and different decision makers perspective are slightly investigated. In this paper, a conceptual framework that can be useful for automated requirements elicitation is introduced. It combines three key elements as one unit: explicit user feedback, different stakeholder's perspective, and similar applications. As a next step to polish our work, we have carefully planned to validate the proposed framework. Furthermore, a tool-support will be designed to automate the conceptual framework. The ultimate goal of this framework aims to help software companies to identify the optimal requirements and features of application in a particular domain, hence reducing human efforts, improving the quality of the product, increasing user satisfaction, improving sustainability in the market and reducing the development lifecycle.","","978-1-5386-4371-6","10.1109/COMAPP.2018.8460407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460407","similar applications;requirements elicitation;user feedback;decision makers","Software;Requirements engineering;Stakeholders;Companies;Big Data;Computer bugs","","","","31","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional tile color difference detection methods often rely on manual visual inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to subjective errors. To address this issue, the paper suggests a Siamese network structure utilizing central difference convolution. Two identical convolutional neural networks are employed to process reference and test samples, and key features are extracted using central difference convolution. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a large dataset containing numerous tile samples is constructed, and detailed experimental evaluations are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in tile color difference detection tasks using the Siamese network architecture based on central difference convolution. The outcomes of this study are of great significance in enhancing the level of quality management in tile production processes and provide a new approach to image-based color difference detection. Future research can further optimize the network architecture and algorithms, explore more feature representations and optimization strategies to further enhance the performance and practicality of tile color difference detection.","","979-8-3503-7323-3","10.1109/ICCBD-AI62252.2023.00123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10551074","Siamese Netword;CDC;Tile Color Difference","Visualization;Image color analysis;Convolution;Tiles;Network architecture;Feature extraction;Ceramics","","","","15","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the diversity of machine learning libraries, the inconsistency between environments, and various scalability requirement, there is no existing work to date that addresses all of these challenges. Here, we introduce Bighead, a framework-agnostic, end-to-end platform for machine learning. It offers a seamless user experience requiring only minimal efforts that span feature set management, prototyping, training, batch (offline) inference, real-time (online) inference, evaluation, and model lifecycle management. In contrast to existing platforms, it is designed to be highly versatile and extensible, and supports all major machine learning frameworks, rather than focusing on one particular framework. It ensures consistency across different environments and stages of the model lifecycle, as well as across data sources and transformations. It scales horizontally and elastically in response to the workload such as dataset size and throughput. Its components include a feature management framework, a model development toolkit, a lifecycle management service with UI, an offline training and inference engine, an online inference service, an interactive prototyping environment, and a Docker image customization tool. It is the first platform to offer a feature management component that is a general-purpose aggregation framework with lambda architecture and temporal joins. Bighead is deployed and widely adopted at Airbnb, and has enabled the data science and engineering teams to develop and deploy machine learning models in a timely and reliable manner. Bighead has shortened the time to deploy a new model from months to days, ensured the stability of the models in production, facilitated adoption of cutting-edge models, and enabled advanced machine learning based product features of the Airbnb platform.

These transforms finds application in compression, enhancement, pattern recognition, and feature extraction etc. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a widely used wavelet transformation. DWT transforms image from space domain to frequency domain, where the wavelets are discretely sampled. DWT has various advantages over other image transforms such as image can be represented in multi resolution form, avoids the division of image into non-overlapping blocks, blocking artifacts are avoided to achieve a high compression ratio, better identification of data suitable for human perception, provides better localization in spatial and frequency domain. DWT implemented on software [Matlab] usually has lower throughput, which is due to high overall design cycle time. This can be improved through hardware implementation of DWT. In this paper an effective high speed DWT architecture has been designed using Distributed Arithmetic (DA) concept. The designed architecture has been simulated and synthesized by using Verilog HDL for the selected device ZYNQZC706 (7z045ffg900-2). Our implementation is validated on a natural image of dimension 512∗512.

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.","2577-0993","978-1-7281-3690-5","10.1109/RAMS48030.2020.9153669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153669","Prognostics;RUL Estimation;Deep Learning;Long-short Term Memory;IIoT;Autoencoder","Time series analysis;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Sensors;Mathematical model;Degradation;Logic gates","","9","","11","IEEE","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asynchronous circuits are an alternative design because they operate by event, so they do not use the clock signal. An essential class of asynchronous circuits that are robust to PVT (process, supply voltage, temperature) variations is the class called quasi delay insensitive (QDI). However, QDI circuits have high overhead in the area due to signal coding, which uses delay-insensitive code and the excessive use of C elements. This paper proposes an architecture based on basic gates to implement QDI combinatorial circuits (QDI_CC) that require a reduced number of C elements in most applications. The QDI_CC circuits implemented in the new architecture interact with the environment in early output; therefore, they are robust in interacting with the environment, requiring a simple timing assumption. The proposal provides to be promising for a set of ten benchmarks comparing the proposed method with three methods from the literature. Our proposal obtained an average reduction of 65.3% in the number of transistors.","","978-1-6654-8854-9","10.1109/ANDESCON56260.2022.9989998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989998","asynchronous logic;QDI class;dual-rail encode;gate orphan","Pipelines;Detectors;Voltage;Logic gates;Benchmark testing;Registers;Proposals","","1","","26","IEEE","28 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To increase the energy efficiency of the electric motor, wound copper wires are being replaced by coated rectangular copper wires, so-called hairpins. Hence, to connect the hairpins conductively, they must be welded together. However, such new production processes are unknown compared with classic motor production. Therefore, this research aims to integrate Industry 4.0 techniques, such as cloud and edge computing, and advanced data analysis in the production process to better understand and optimize the manufacturing processes. Welding defects are classified with the help of a convolutional neural network (CNN) (predictive analysis) and, depending on the defect, a recommended course of action for reworking (prescriptive analysis) is given. However, the application of such complex algorithms as neural networks to large amounts of data requires huge computing resources. Therefore, a modular combination of an edge and cloud architecture is proposed in this paper.

The mainstream attention mechanism is established upon the non-local block, also known as an essential component of the prominent Transformer networks, to catch long-range correlations. However, such unilateral attention is often hampered by sparse and obscure responses, revealing insufficient dependencies across images/patches, and high computational cost, especially for those employing the multi-head design. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel mechanism of aggregating bilateral attention (ABA) and validate its usefulness in tackling the task of few-shot instance localization, reflecting the underlying query-support dependency. Specifically, our method facilitates uncovering informative features via assessing: i) an embedding norm for exploring the semantically-related cues; ii) context awareness for correlating the query data and support regions. ABA is then carried out by integrating the affinity relations derived from the two measurements to serve as a lightweight but effective query-support attention mechanism with high localization recall. We evaluate ABA on two localization tasks, namely, few-shot action localization and one-shot object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ABA achieves superior performances over existing methods.","2642-9381","978-1-6654-9346-8","10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10030110","Algorithms: Machine learning architectures;formulations;and algorithms (including transfer);Image recognition and understanding (object detection;categorization;segmentation;scene modeling;visual reasoning);Video recognition and understanding (tracking;action recognition;etc.)","Location awareness;Filtering;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Focusing;Context awareness;Object detection","","4","","51","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One challenge when running applications on a multi-cloud is to establish an efficient and secure communication between the cloud nodes that are distributed over several geographic locations and local area networks (LANs). In this paper, we propose and implement a novel OpenVPN-based node interconnection in multi-clouds.

This includes AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) which brings the benefit of steering electronically the transmitted radio-wave beam through constructive and destructive interference between the different channel output - for a transmitter - or input - for a receiver. Another example is MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems. Multiple channels are used to improve the transmission capability as well as mitigate and compensate noise effect in the transmission medium. These kinds of system can reach up to 100s of channels and thus are interested into products that are easy enough to implement on a large scale. They also require synchronization between channels to be able to control the steering for AESA system or be able to transmit the data correctly for MIMO systems. In parallel to the large array systems, direct conversion is progressively adopted in order to bring new SDR (Software Defined Radio) capabilities to the system, translating into flexibility at the application level. In such kind of systems, the driving characteristic is the data converter input - for ADC (Analog to Digital Convert) - and output - for DAC (Digital to Analog Convert) bandwidth. This paper will offer an overview of AESA and MIMO systems associated with direct conversion and their benefits at application level. It will then present and explain a few features that are essential for these types of application at the data converter level. It will use the example of the EV12AD500 a dual-channel 1.5GSps 12 bits ADC by Teledyne e2v offering direct conversion capabilities up to the C-band.

However, today Internet security is a quickly growing concern. The prevalence of Internet attacks has increased significantly, but still the challenge of detecting such attacks generally falls on the end hosts and service providers, requiring system administrators to detect and block attacks on their own. In particular, as social networks have become central hubs of information and communication, they are increasingly the target of attention and attacks. This creates a challenge of carefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones. Previous work has shown that for a variety of Internet attacks, there is a small subset of connection measurements that are good indicators of whether a connection is part of an attack or not. In this paper we look at the effectiveness of using two different co-clustering algorithms to both cluster connections as well as mark which connection measurements are strong indicators of what makes any given cluster anomalous relative to the total data set. We run experiments with these co-clustering algorithms on the KDD 1999 Cup data set. In our experiments we find that soft co-clustering, running on samples of data, finds consistent parameters that are strong indicators of anomalous detections and creates clusters, that are highly pure. When running hard co-clustering on the full data set (over 100 runs), we on average have one cluster with 92.44% attack connections and the other with 75.84% normal connections. These results are on par with the KDD 1999 Cup winning entry, showing that co-clustering is a strong, unsupervised method for separating normal connections from anomalous ones. Finally, we believe that the ideas presented in this work may inspire research for anomaly detection in social networks, such as identifying spammers and fraudsters.","","978-1-4673-2497-7","10.1109/ASONAM.2012.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425732","","Clustering algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Internet;Security;Principal component analysis;Approximation methods;Radio access networks","","26","1","27","IEEE","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Safety standards have evolved in this area pushing companies to design safer and more robust systems with which to do this complex work. The Norwegian government issued standards that require companies drilling in their waters to adhere to Safety Integrity Level (SIL) standards developed by the IEC. The true technical challenge when developing a SIL system for the drilling industry is in collecting consistent component reliability data. This data challenge occurs in most industries because each company that collects reliability data does so using their own methodology. These various methods often result in data sets that are either far more conservative than necessary or may actually discount certain failures that should be included. To design a safety system that is robust, the design team should use a method that is robust to variations in the failure rate data. Calculation of the probability of failure on demand includes the failure rate data, diagnostic coverage, test interval, and common cause failure analysis. By designing the appropriate proof tests, a safety system can be designed so that variations in the failure rate data will be less important because any fault in the equipment will be detected before the equipment is demanded in use.","0149-144X","978-1-4799-6703-2","10.1109/RAMS.2015.7105116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105116","IEC61508 PDF Reliability Safety SIL","Safety;Reliability;Phase frequency detector;Sensitivity;IEC standards;Industries","","2","","13","IEEE","11 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Metals play a key role in Enabling Sustainability through societies various high-tech applications. However, the resources of our planet are limited, as is the strain to which we can subject it in terms of emissions, pollution, and disposal of waste. For these reasons, finding ways to lower the environmental footprint of our collective existence and therefore lowering greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change is a vital priority ([1], [2]). The maximization of resource efficiency [3] is the principal theme of this contribution. It will be shown in depth the detail that is required to systemically fully understand resource efficiency in the context of material use, illustrating this by example of E-waste recycling. The opportunities and limits of recycling are discussed with a specific emphasis on the physics and related economics of recycling. Through this Design for Resource Efficiency is elaborated on. In support of this, the detailed data that are required, the technological understanding and design rules are among others implicitly highlighted that impact on resource efficiency. Specifically the understanding of Product- Centric recycling is highlighted setting it apart from the usual Material-Centric recycling approaches (which focus more on bulk materials) and therefore inherently limit especially the maximal recovery of technologically critical elements - these limitations will be discussed.","","978-3-8396-0439-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360421","","Abstracts;Recycling;Economics","","","","8","","24 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to assure the load balancing and to optimize the resource utilization, a distributed system is using different software components, such as management tools, schedulers or monitoring tools. Considering the prediction of future behavior of distributed systems resources can offer better results in optimization and control. This paper proposes a state prediction algorithm based on neural networks using a genetic algorithm for initialization. The algorithm combines the advantages of the neural networks with the advantages of a dynamically constructed architecture and the very good results offered by a genetic algorithm. The prediction system includes the MonALISA monitoring system that collects information about the current status of the available resources in a distributed system. The algorithm is used in order to predict the next value or the next interval of values for parameters such as load, free memory or network bandwidth.

The reuse of proven solutions (e.g., Safety Mechanisms or architecture designs) for safety-critical applications is considered a good practice for increasing confidence in the system and cutting development cost and time, and is widely-spread in practice. However, reuse in safety-critical applications is mostly ad-hoc, with lack of process maturity or adequate tool support. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the quality or completeness of a reuse process, if there is no ""definition of done"". We defined a structured ""Pattern Library"" approach for the reuse of Safety Mechanisms (fault avoidance / error detection and handling) in the automotive domain, elaborating a prototypical tool implementation for both Pattern Developer and User role. I pragmatically demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach via the evaluation of instantiations into a generic research CASE tool (AutoFOCUS3), as well as a domain-adequate automotive safety modeling framework (SAFE Framework), which subjectively demonstrate improvements in the maturity, adequacy and completeness of the reuse, as well as how the approach can be used to guide tool selection, development and/or extension. I also showcased how the approach can generally be applied to other system design reuse problems, via an instantiation into a large scale automotive functional & technical component library at a leading automotive supplier. These steps and results have been published. The next steps are to consolidate and formalize the instantiations and their results to provide academic rigor to the approach.","","978-1-7281-5125-0","10.1109/MODELS-C.2019.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8904748","reuse, design patterns, safety mechanisms, component based engineering, model based engineering","","","2","","45","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basic idea is to bypass blocks of logic when their function is not required, using low delay and area overhead components (transmission gates). The internal state of these blocks is kept unchanged, so the switching activity of the circuit is minimized, resulting to low dynamic power consumption. While this idea offers great savings mainly to array multipliers, due to their regular interconnection scheme, the reduced area and fast speed of tree multipliers is a real temptation for the designer. Therefore, a mixed style architecture, using a traditional, tree based part, combined with a bypass, array based part, is proposed. Through extensive experimentation it has been found that the bypass technique offers minimum power consumption for all cases while the mixed architecture offers a delay*power product improvement ranging from 1.2x to 6.5x, compared to all other architectures.","","978-1-4244-6340-4","10.1109/DTIS.2010.5487585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5487585","low-power design;dynamic power;digital multipliers;data gating;transmission gates","Clocks;Delay;Energy consumption;Switching circuits;Integrated circuit interconnections;Power dissipation;Very large scale integration;Digital signal processing;Isolation technology;Computer architecture","","1","","17","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new applications of CNN request computing demands that are difficult to address by conventional processors.As a consequence, accelerators -both prototypes and commercial products- focusing on CNN computation have been proposed. Among these accelerators, those based on systolic arrays have acquired a special relevance; some examples are the Google's TPU and Eyeriss.Current research has focused on regular squared systolic arrays and most existing work assumes that there is enough memory bandwidth to feed the systolic array with input data. In this paper we explore the design of non-squared systolic arrays and address the impact of the memory bandwidth from a performance perspective.This work makes two main contributions. First, we found that some workloads with non-squared arrays achieve similar performance to systolic arrays twice as large, which can translate in area and/or energy benefits.Second, we present a performance comparison varying the main memory bandwidth for current DRAM devices. The analysis reveals that main memory bandwidth has a great impact on performance and that the decision of which technology use is key for the system performance. For the 64x64 array size it is necessary to use HBM2 memory to avoid the slowdown that would introduce cheaper technologies (e.g. DDR5 and DDR4).","","978-1-7281-9535-3","10.1109/DSD51259.2020.00086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217842","convolutional neural networks;systolic arrays;architectural parameters;performance;main memory technology","Arrays;Bandwidth;Random access memory;Google;Memory management;Performance evaluation","","3","","14","IEEE","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the poverty to the elite class food is one of the major components for the people to live. Keeping this in mind, we have been motivated to take up a challenge to construct a device that can detect the taste of food in a unique and automated way. In the electronic tongue which we have proposed to develop will consist of an IR sensor which will emit Infrared rays to detect the proper taste of the food and will identify the five tastes (bitter, salty, sour, sweet, and umami). It will not only detect the particular taste but it will also show the percentage presence of the particular taste detected (sweetness, saltiness etc.). The whole process will be done during the preparation of the food if it is kept at the production centre. This will be done with the help of a sensor whose architecture has been designed and the sensor has been incorporated in the arduino board where different color LED's has been provided which will glow depending on the particular taste has which will be detected. The following sensor circuit has been designed in OrcadPspice and its simulation with different colors of LED's has been taken to segregate the five tastes separately. The colors are namely violet for sour taste, blue for bitter taste, green for salty taste, orange for sweet taste and red for savory (umami) taste. Besides that, applying the concepts of biotechnology each of the chemicals producing the particular sense has been identified and IR rays has been passed through it to generate the signals in a microcontroller. The amplitude of the generated distortion will indicate the percentage presence of the taste in the food. This will not only enhance the quality of food but also help in indicating any rotten particle or microorganism present in food. It will have a large application in dry food manufacturing industries (lays, kurkure, nestle, metro),food courts, restaurants and medicine manufacturing companies.","","978-1-7281-2791-0","10.1109/Confluence47617.2020.9058134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058134","electronic tongue;interdigitated capacitor;sensing membrane;dielectric constant;response time","Chemicals;Cloud computing;Data science;Immune system;Sensors;Conferences;Integrated circuit modeling","","1","","5","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we present an effective multimodal BP SLAM for robust inference with ambiguities. Using Gaussian bandwidth mean shift and cluster-based reparameterization, we reduce the number of Gaussian components in each message due to the BP nature.

Increases in data volume and processing needs necessitate more powerful hardware and more flexible software architectures to satisfy these needs. Such improvements in processed data also mean the overall system becomes more complex and correspondingly, resulting in a potentially significantly larger cyber-attack space. Today's multicore processors are one means of satisfying the increased computational needs of data fusion-based systems. When coupled with a real-time operating system (RTOS) capable of flexible core and application scheduling, large cabinets of (power hungry) single-core processors may be avoided. The functional and assurance capabilities of such an RTOS can be critical elements in providing application isolation, constrained data flows, and restricted hardware access (including covert channel prevention) necessary to reduce the overall cyber-attack space. This paper examines fundamental considerations of a multiple independent levels of security (MILS) architecture when supported by a multicore-based real-time operating system. The paper draws upon assurance activities and functional properties associated with a previous Common Criteria evaluation assurance level (EAL) 6+ / High-Robustness Separation Kernel certification effort and contrast those with activities performed as part of a MILS multicore related project. The paper discusses key characteristics and functional capabilities necessary to achieve overall system security and safety. The paper defines architectural considerations essential for scheduling applications on a multicore processor to reduce security risks. For civil aircraft systems, the paper discusses the applicability of the security assurance and architecture configurations to system providers looking to increase their resilience to cyber threats.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081638","Multicore;Separation Kernel;High Robustness;INTEGRITY-178 tuMP;MILS","","","","","20","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new 8T SRAM bit-cell to reduce the overall area of the SRAM array, which is able to implement the 1-bit multiplication without read-disturb issue. Additionally, the interleaving adder tree and dual supply voltage strategy are employed for further reduction on area and power consumption of computational circuits. Besides, a result combination circuit is designed to increase the bit-precision flexibility. A 16Kb SRAM CIM macro with proposed techniques is designed in a 40-nm CMOS technology.

Pairing computation is considered to be one of the promising components to construct such advanced cryptosystems. However, the computation time of the pairing, which involves the processing of complicated algebraic calculations, is a major obstacle for achieving the practical application. Previous studies in hardware implementation pairings mainly aim to improve the performance of the area-time product. While these studies prefer the usage of the resource-restricted environment, some server-side applications, such as attribute-based encryption for video streaming, require the implementation of low latency instead of the area-time product. This study proposes a low-latency pairing processor architecture and its optimal pipeline scheduling.

They enable the evaluation of decisions already early in development processes. Simulators are focused on a subset of effects that affect the operation of embedded systems. Accurate prediction of embedded system behavior on system level, however, requires the consideration of multiple effects, e.g. communication behavior, system environments, and functional behavior of all relevant system components. This requires the coupling of specialized simulators to create holistic simulation scenarios. In this paper, we present FERAL, our framework for simulator coupling, which enables the integration of simulators with heterogeneous simulation models. We describe the overall coupling approach of FERAL, its simulation model, and its approach for the horizontal and vertical integration of simulation models. We show the applicability of FERAL by a realistic example that demonstrates the potential of simulator coupling for early fault detection.","","978-1-4799-0905-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670936","Simulator coupling;requirements;architecture;framework;early simulation;FERAL","Couplings;Semantics;Integrated circuit modeling;Ports (Computers);Software packages;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","","1","","11","","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of this paper is to propose scientific and technical directions to reach global data and power sobriety while preserving computational efficiency. We present nine opportunities to lower the power consumption of computing units. A growth factor of 100 to 1000 in energy efficiency is achievable in the next 10 years if we take full advantage of all the potential improvements, working simultaneously at all five levels of the technological ecosystem (process steps, circuits, architecture, software and algorithms). We will indeed need to exploit all the possible technological advances to achieve this goal, including resistive memories, 3D stacking and new computing paradigms such as in-memory-computing, neuromorphic computing and quantum computing. Additionally, in order to maximize efficiency and performance, the research and development communities must work closer together and embrace a real culture of co-design to optimize applications and algorithms, algorithms and architectures, architectures and technologies jointly. We also propose to perform data processing operations as closely as possible to the source, in order to curtail the energy consumption that comes with data transport.

We intro-duce an interpretation method that observes the saliency map and visual input, which is used to calculate the component-wise product to remove the noise. Using gradient-based visualization, multimodal convolutional networks perform for visual inputs. The component-wise product is used to visualize the input by analyzing the learned weights of the layers. The saliency map is generated by the guided back-propagation of the ReLU activation function.

Storage Area Networks play a very vital role in the data center architecture by using specialized storage hardware to manage data. In this paper, we have extended the Green Cloud simulator for computing the energy consumed by different SAN components. A simulation environment for SAN has been presented using the 'Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling' (DVFS) and 'Dynamic Shutdown' (DNS) techniques. The simulation results obtained through two SAN prototype models shows the energy consumption of SAN components to vary with the network topology and type of technique used in scheduling of the workloads. Our experimental simulations revealed that there is an increasing percentage of energy savings in DNS mode for both topologies for an increasing number of servers.

To implement features, we might use aspect-oriented programming (AOP), in which aspects enable a clear separation between base code and variable code. In this context, recent work provides AspectJ-based idioms to implement flexible feature binding. However, we identified some design deficiencies. Thus, to solve the issues of these idioms, we incrementally create three new AspectJ-based idioms.

RP is used as a DSP in Samsung DTV and Camera to run the Audio, Video codecs and image quality enhancement algorithms. RP runs in two modes: VLIW (Very Large Instruction Word) and CGRA (Coarse Grain Reconfigurable Array). To minimize the time-to-market of products, application developers of the RP require a fast and cycle-accurate profiling-enabled simulator to verify the functionality of applications and to optimize the hot-spots (performance critical codes). Further, fast simulation is necessary to verify the functionalities for certification of various standards of multimedia (DivX, Dolby, etc.). The state-of-the-art RP simulators are very slow running at 2 MIPS (Million instructions per second) in CGRA mode and 4 MIPS in VLIW mode, running on x86 host processor at 3.4 GHz. We propose FastSim, a fast compile based cycle-accurate simulator for RP, which yields simulation speed of 900 MIPS in CGRA mode and 1600 MIPS in VLIW mode with > 99.5% core cycle accuracy. Thus, FastSim enables ~400x faster simulation when compared to existing RP simulators. FastSim in VLIW mode is 2x faster when compared to the state-of-the-art functional simulators, and 16x faster when compared to cycle-accurate simulators, of the VLIW and RISC processors in the industry. FastSim speed is also comparable to application running time on native x86. The faster simulation speed is achieved with the use of an innovative maximal static analysis in both VLIW and CGRA modes.","2379-447X","978-1-4673-6853-7","10.1109/ISCAS.2017.8050318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050318","","VLIW;Schedules;Registers;Radio frequency;Delays;Computer architecture;Optimization","","","","15","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite its widespread use, however, little guidance is available for testing engineers facing the problem of selecting the best test strategy. In previous work, we proposed to adopt functional models and related testing patterns according to the architectural style of the application under test. In this paper, we present an industrial study that applies this technique to system testing of repository based applications. We define a set of functional models abstracting different concerns of software applications: hierarchy of functions, business processes and states/transitions of application objects. The models are used to derive the functional test cases through the definition of test patterns. We applied this approach in an industrial context for over 5 years. In this paper, we analyze a data set of 37 test projects including about 22000 test cases and 1500 failures. We relate failures to the originating defect types. The study confirms that a system test strategy that uses multiple functional models according to the architectural style of the software application generates a better cost/benefit ratio than the use of just one model. The explanation is that - despite a small overlap - each model detects specific types of software defects. The results of the study can guide testing engineers in selecting the best system test strategy and significantly improve the efficiency of their work.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883301","System test;multiple models;software defects","Software;Business;Databases;System testing;Guidelines;Unified modeling language","","","","25","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the influencing factors is accurately located through the optimal substructure theory, and the indicators is reasonably divided to reduce interference, and the dynamic programming method is used to construct an improvement scheme of the quality control system. Experimental results show that under certain evaluation criteria, the proposed scheme is superior to the traditional rotation algorithm in terms of the improvement accuracy of the quality control system and the processing time of influencing factors, and has obvious advantages. The improvement of the quality control system plays an extremely important role in digital engineering, which can accurately predict and optimize the growth characteristics and product generation of digital engineering. However, the traditional rotation algorithm has certain limitations in solving the simulation problem of the control system, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this paper, an improvement scheme of the quality control system based on dynamic programming method is proposed to better solve this problem. In this scheme, the influencing factors is accurately located through the optimal substructure theory, so as to determine the division of indicators, and the dynamic programming method is used to construct the scheme. Experimental results show that under certain evaluation criteria, the accuracy and speed of the scheme is significantly improved for different problems, and it has better performance.

Drones’ authentication is one of the primary security services that should be lightweight to enable real-time access to the data submitted by legitimate drones.

To implement two-way communication between smart grid components, machine-to-machine communications has a great potential. In this paper, we propose a machine-to-machine architecture for advanced metering infrastructure in Internet of Things-based smart grid and focus on finding the optimum number of collectors based on two metrics: collectors' cost and packet delay. We model advanced metering infrastructure as a queuing system and derive an expression for packet delay.

"A Phased Based Approach for PHM","E. Cota; R. Mayo",Raytheon; Raytheon,2021 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS),"22 Nov 2021","2021","","","1","6","This paper provides a phased approach to gathering performance data required to determine the health of a system and predict its remaining useful life (RUL) also known as Prognostic Health Management (PHM). The approach enables service life extension and/or scheduled maintenance decisions. The phased based approach is applied throughout a products design lifecycle to ""design-in"" testability to collect performance data required to provide a statistical predictor of RUL. This PHM approach starts during system concept development continue through sustainment phase in order to statistically analyze for performance degradation and predicted RUL. The approach uses statistical analysis of key parameters to predict future performance and support service life extension (SLE) or schedule repairs to prevent unplanned failures.Currently, the design methods use military or commercial reliability prediction standards. The resulting predictions reflect the initial design reliability based on similar technologies produced by various manufactures with test history. The current analysis method does not account for manufacturing changes, planned testing nor adjusted for performance wear out over time. Additionally, current predictions tell you what the design can achieve but does not notify the user if it will achieve success or inform you when the design reliability degrades past set performance limits. The current prediction methods also, do not incorporate the designs test results and therefore does not predict how the designed system performs over the design cycle. Lastly, the current method does not predict operational failures or support operational extension.The phased based approach for PHM is divided into five phases to provide the data required to predict continued operational compliance or predict failure:•Phase 0: Concept Design and Planning•Phase 0.1: Design in test functions and plan design development and sustainment efforts•Phase 1: Design test architecture and set design requirements•Phase 1.1: Design a Built in Test (BIT) that collects and report parametric data on components that could degrade over time•Phase 1.2: Plan a stockpile of LOT representative HW to collect parametric data for devices that are considered one shots.•Phase 1.3: Design a supportability plan that will measure the results periodically and perform the required repair that meets availability requirements•Phase 2: Design test approach•Phase 2.1: Identify life limiting components and their expected output (outputs become key parameters)•Phase 2.2: Collect initial test results for key parameters•Update the BIT design for the detailed design that collects and report parametric data on components that could degrade over time•Phase 2.3: Update the stockpile plan for the detailed design and for devices with life limiting components•Phase 2.4: Update the supportability plan for design details and additional repairs required to repair life limiting components while maintaining compliance to availability requirements•Phase 3: Verify test results and set the base data set•Phase 3.1: Collect and analyze key performance data statistically to ensure they support requirements•Phase 3.2: Set the base statistics for the expected test outputs•Phase 4 Monitor for continued compliance•Phase 4.1: Periodically collect test results and statistically assess for trendsThe methods support collaboration with system designer, operations, and test planners to identify key performance parameters and design for supportability. The approach provides quantifiable metrics that extend operational usage or plan scheduled repairs. Schedule repairs typically reduce availability downtimes by allowing the end user to schedule repair spares, prepare repair equipment prior to a failure, and preorder replacement components to optimize operational up time.","2577-0993","978-1-7281-8017-5","10.1109/RAMS48097.2021.9605782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605782","Life Data Analysis;Remaining Useful Life;Reliability Centered Maintenance;Maintenance Models and Methodologies;Physical Reliability Models;Prognostics and Health Management","Performance evaluation;Schedules;Limiting;Uncertainty;Maintenance engineering;Reliability engineering;Market research","","","","10","USGov","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To make matters worse, DRAM bandwidth is increasing much slower than per CPU core count, while DRAM latency has been virtually stagnant. Parallel applications that are bound by memory bandwidth fail to scale, while applications bound by memory latency draw a small fraction of much-needed bandwidth. While expert programmers may be able to tune important applications by hand through heroic effort, traditional compiler cache optimizations have not been sufficiently aggressive to overcome the growing DRAM gap. In this paper, we introduce milk — a C/C++ language extension that allows programmers to annotate memory-bound loops concisely. Using optimized intermediate data structures, random indirect memory references are transformed into batches of efficient sequential DRAM accesses. A simple semantic model enhances programmer productivity for efficient parallelization with OpenMP.

The paper begins with an overview of the methodology and its use in the form of multi-component network models. Using such a network, a performance assessment model is proposed that takes into account the key vectors of thermofluidic performance, energy efficiency (operational cost), and environmental sustainability of a given system. We then apply the methodology for data center management. By applying to an example case study of a traditional data center, we show how an exergo-thermo-volume network can be used to gain insight into the design and operation of the compute as well as cooling infrastructures. Differences in infrastructure performance across various operating environments are discussed, and an optimal design that trades off key vectors of thermofluidic performance, operational cost and environmental sustainability is developed.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate daily NSSR over rugged surfaces at 1-km resolution for both clear and cloudy days. All the atmospheric input data were derived from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and therefore the errors from multi-sensor architectures were avoided. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing its results with field measurements at four sites, and the correlation coefficients of NSSR varied between 0.71∼0.93.

This has led to substantial memory capacity requirements, necessitating the use of dozens of GPUs just to meet the capacity. One popular solution to this is storage-offloaded training, which uses host memory and storage as an extended memory hierarchy. However, this obviously comes at the cost of storage bandwidth bottleneck because storage devices have orders of magnitude lower bandwidth compared to that of GPU device memories. Our work, Smart-Infinity, addresses the storage bandwidth bottleneck of storage-offloaded LLM training using near-storage processing devices on a real system. The main component of Smart-Infinity is SmartUpdate, which performs parameter updates on custom near-storage accelerators. We identify that moving parameter updates to the storage side removes most of the storage traffic. In addition, we propose an efficient data transfer handler structure to address the system integration issues for Smart-Infinity. The handler allows overlapping data transfers with fixed memory consumption by reusing the device buffer. Lastly, we propose accelerator-assisted gradient compression/decompression to enhance the scalability of Smart-Infinity. When scaling to multiple near-storage processing devices, the write traffic on the shared channel becomes the bottleneck. To alleviate this, we compress the gradients on the GPU and decompress them on the accelerators. It provides further acceleration from reduced traffic. As a result, Smart-Infinity achieves a significant speedup compared to the baseline. Notably, SmartInfinity is a ready-to-use approach that is fully integrated into PyTorch on a real system. The implementation of Smart-Infinity is available at https://github.com/AIS-SNU/smart-infinity.","2378-203X","979-8-3503-9313-2","10.1109/HPCA57654.2024.00034","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)(grant numbers:2022R1C1C1011307,2022R1C1C1008131); Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP2023-RS-2023-00256081); MSIT; Ministry of Education (MOE); National Research Foundation (NRF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476401","Processing in-memory/near-memory/in-cache;FPGA: Architectures and accelerators;Large Language Models (LLMs)","Training;Performance evaluation;Scalability;Memory management;Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;System integration","","3","","130","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, memristor-based accelerators are equipped with selector elements to reduce cross-talk through sneak paths along unselected lines. However, due to the large drive strength required for selector elements, it comes at the cost of synaptic crossbar density. Selector- less alternatives require careful design of crossbar peripheral circuits to mitigate or eliminate sneak path-induced cross-talk. We propose a hybrid integrated platform that interfaces a selector- less memristor crossbar array with peripheral row and column instrumentation for array-parallel programming and readout for AI learning and inference applications. The proposed switched-capacitor voltage-sensing instrumentation avoids the need for current-sensing schemes with voltage-clamped sense lines that are typically used to mitigate the sneak path issues in selector- less crossbars but are substantially less energy-efficient than voltage-sensing. Our board-level platform is implemented using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data converters and switched capacitors, and is controlled by a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The system offers programmable sense times to characterize memristors over a wide range of resistances and the capability to switch between a transient-domain measurement and steady-state measurement to offer the desired trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency during inference parallel readout. We implement a differential weight-encoding scheme to improve the accuracy of matrix-vector multiplication. The system also supports an array-level programming scheme for parallel write access as well as online learning-in-memory for neuromorphic applications through outer-product incremental decomposition of the weight matrix. Thus, our system offers a generic, user-configurable, and versatile platform to support wide dynamic range measurements of synaptic crossbar arrays and cognitive neuromorphic computing with emerging non-volatile memory devices.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181867","Neuromorphic computing;memristors;voltage-sensing;matrix-vector-multiplication;incremental outer-product-learning","Nonvolatile memory;Instruments;Memristors;Energy measurement;Switches;Programming;Energy efficiency","","3","","8","USGov","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A higher budget for promotion and a lower profit are the outcomes of overestimating the sales volume, which results in lower actual sales than predicted. Therefore, accurate sales volume forecasting is essential for sellers to choose the best methods of advertisement. The quantity of sales predicting approach in this case is one that predicts future sales based on historical data for the particular supplier, as well as the advertising techniques to be used on the relevant future days, sales volume from the past, dynamic influencing elements like past marketing strategies and weather data, and the static characteristics of the specific vendor are all examples of historical information. As a result, merchants use the expected forthcoming gross revenue under various stuff to choose the deal strategy to be employed. This work suggests a clustering-based forecasting methodology for predicting sales by fusing clustering and machine-learning techniques. The suggested method first divided the training data into groups using the clustering technique, which groups data with comparable features or patterns. The forecasting models for each group are then, using machine learning techniques, it was trained. Once, the cluster's trained forecasting model was chosen for sales forecasting. It was determined which cluster's data patterns matched the test data the most closely. Because sales data reflect similar data patterns or features over time, the presented clustering-based forecasting methodology can enhance forecast accuracy. Three machine learning techniques are used in this paper: Generalized Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosted Tree, as well as two clustering techniques: Self Organizing Map (SOM) and K-mean clustering. A predictive model that is most suited for predicting the sales trend is presented based on a performance evaluation. Discussion of the data is done in terms of the precision and accuracy of good prediction systems. The best-fit model is chosen to be the Gradient Boosted Tree Algorithm and it has the highest level of forecasting and sales prediction accuracy.

It facilitates the description of complex system design, as a hierarchy of interacting system components, while at the same time enables the independent description of each component behaviour. However, in order for the system designer to decide whether a SoS architecture is efficient, non-functional properties, such as performance or cost, should also be taken into consideration. There are numerous efforts integrating performance properties into SysML models and their verification using stochastic or analytical methods. In this paper, we focus on the financial assessment of SysML models, estimating economic attributes of SoS architectures, such as Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Return of Investment (ROI). Integrating different viewpoints into SysML SoS models, focusing besides structure and behaviour, also performance and economic attributes, enables the system designer to explore alternative solutions for system design, having in mind a wider perspective of the system under investigation. To this end, a profile extending SysML to serve techno-economic analysis of systems is introduced. As an example, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for cloud infrastructures, modelled as SoS is explored. TCO properties are incorporated into existing SysML cloud models, enabling the designer to compute TCO for the whole system or parts of it.","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088276","","Biological system modeling;Modeling;Economics;Tools;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Unified modeling language","","2","","31","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, over ten thousand experiments are run annually.

For datasets larger than the last-level cache, this performance drops to 50 Gflops. Our performance is 2-3X higher than a well-known implementation from the Chroma software suite when running on the same hardware platform. The novel implementation of LQCD reported in this paper is based on recently published the 3.5D spatial and 4.5D temporal tiling schemes. Both blocking schemes significantly reduce LQCD external memory bandwidth requirements, delivering a more compute-bound implementation. The performance advantage of our schemes will become more significant as the gap between compute flops and external memory bandwidth continues to grow. We demonstrate very good cluster-level scalability of our implementation: for a lattice of 32 x 256 sites, we achieve over 4 Tflops when strong-scaled to a 128 node system (1536 cores total). For the same lattice size, a full Conjugate Gradients Wilson-Dslash operator, achieves 2.95 Tflops.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-0771-0","10.1145/2063384.2063477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114421","","Lattices;Bandwidth;Memory management;Sockets;Kernel;Vectors;Multicore processing","","6","","33","","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To perform most efficient arithmetic based calculations, Montgomery multiplication can be one of the best alternatives for other conventional methods in digital architecture as high-speed multipliers are desired for its remarkable performance. The main drawback of the digital multipliers is that power exhaustion is very high when compared to the other elements of the digital circuit. Shift register is the one of the most important component in a digital multiplier which consumes comparatively higher power than the other components. Shift registers contains a series of D-flip flops to store the digital data. In order to obtain a notable improvement in terms of power consumption at the chip level, the flip-flop can be modified to achieve the reduction of average power in the multiplier. The Fin-Field Effect Transistor (FinFET) is a promising candidate to overcome fundamental limitations of its Silicon based alternative MOSFET. However, there seems to be an increase in leakage power and delay. The Junctionless FinFET with uniform doping in the channel proves to offer a better performance in terms of overall speed, power consumption and power delay product. The architecture has been designed in 7nm FinFET and JL-FinFET in Synopsys HSpice and Silvaco TCAD. The results of the Montgomery Multiplier affirms that the overall energy is improved by 55% and speed of the device by 35% as compared to the existing Montgomery Multiplier.","","978-1-6654-3897-1","10.1109/ICECCE52056.2021.9514146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514146","Montgomery Multiplier;Flip Flop;Fin-Field Effect Transistor;Junctionless FinFET;Average Power;Power Delay Product","Performance evaluation;Power demand;Doping;FinFETs;Shift registers;Silicon;Delays","","","","11","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MTComm was developed to provide remote monitoring and operation services of manufacturing machines over the Internet. Here we designed an MTComm based edge computing hub (MEH) that connects to heterogeneous physical resources using their own languages and protocols and exchanges information with cloud applications through RESTful services and XML messages. Based on IoT data acquired through MEHs, the IGSDC system tracks grocery product inventories, notifies consumers when they are running low on grocery products, and offers available purchase options from different suppliers. On the other hand, suppliers connect their warehouse robots using MEHs to the cloud by publishing their monitoring and operation capabilities and perform product delivery remotely using autonomous mobile robots. Using MEHs, users can monitor, manage, and operate their resources both locally and remotely. This paper describes different components and processes of the four-layered service-oriented IGSDC system. It also discusses how MTComm is utilized for edge computing in both environments to improve scalability and efficiency.

Experience has showed, however, that due to its aforementioned complexity, such hardware devices can yield to a lengthy development.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have also been investigated intensively for prediction purposes. Current approaches lack in the capability of constructing prediction models for both process and anomaly behavior. Furthermore, they do not deliver a solution for short-term as well as long-term anomalies. Hence, the current paper presents a novel detection and prediction procedure based on a LSTM architecture to cooperatively predict process outputs and anomalies by using two separate but interacting models. The anomaly detector is realized as stacked LSTM auto-encoder and the cooperative prediction models are based on sequence-to-sequence networks with gated recurrent units for short-term and LSTM for long-term effects.

In practice, hard-to-model complex environments are unfeasible to be simulated exhaustively within a reasonable time frame. Therefore, some corner-case conditions can be overlooked and design errors might escape to the final product. This means that it is imperative for the system to be able to detect and locate bugs to enable self-repair. This is particularly crucial during long-term remote missions in order to apply graceful degradation. This paper proposes a novel online design error localization methodology for microprocessors by immediate analysis of traced and buffered signals upon a failure detection event, using a pre-trained Neural Network (NN) and existing processor components, i.e. trace buffers and AI accelerators. An in-house Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework is used to train a tailored Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN for error localization at the microprocessor module-level resolution.

It allows not only to increase in functionality in novel product generations, but also the spreading of electronics into new environments. In recent years, especially the application of electronic functions close to or onto the human skin (i.e. by textiles or band aids), implants and novel biomorphic user interfaces have attracted considerable development efforts. It turns out, however, that miniaturization alone does not cover all requirements in the indicated application fields. Typical systems consist of sensors/actuators, data processing and transmission, and quite often relatively bulky power supplies. In order to meet the mechanical requirements of novel products (softness, drapability), miniaturized system elements are laterally distributed and interconnected by appropriate wiring architectures. A common feature of the above indicated application cases is the conformation of the distributed electronic systems to three-dimensional free form surfaces, which are either dynamically moving (human skin) or static. In order to conform to different types of surfaces the systems typically need to sustain a certain elongation repeatedly (in dynamical applications) or at least once during a forming process. At Fraunhofer IZM a portfolio of technologies, summarized as conformable electronics, has been developed, encompassing textile, stretchable circuit boards, paste printed and thermo-formable electronics on a variety of dielectric carrier materials. Each technology provides on one hand the electrical interconnection network and on the other hand technologies to assemble, interconnect and encapsulate electronic components thereon. Having been developed separately it turned out, that combination of the technologies are possible which leads to a number of synergies and extended of application potentials.","2475-8418","978-1-7281-0978-7","10.1109/ICSJ47124.2019.8998743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998743","conformable;e-Textiles;stretchable;hybrid integration","Textiles;Copper;Conductors;Integrated circuit interconnections;Electronic components;Surface treatment;Printed circuits","","5","","16","IEEE","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With increasing amounts of data and stringent response-time requirements, improving the underlying implementation of semantic analysis becomes critical. To this end, we look at Supervised Semantic Indexing (SSI), a recently proposed algorithm for semantic analysis. SSI ranks a large number of documents based on their semantic similarity to a text query. For each query, it computes millions of dot products on unstructured data, generates a large intermediate result, and then performs ranking. SSI underperforms on both state-of-the-art multi-cores as well as GPUs. Its performance scalability on multi-cores is hampered by their limited support for fine-grained data parallelism. GPUs, though beat multi-cores by running thousands of threads, cannot handle large intermediate data because of their small on-chip memory. Motivated by this, we present an FPGA-based hardware accelerator for semantic analysis. As a key feature, the accelerator combines hundreds of simple processing elements together with in-memory processing to simultaneously generate and process (consume) the large intermediate data. It also supports “dynamic parallelism” - a feature that configures the PEs differently for full utilization of the available processin logic after the FPGA is programmed. Our FPGA prototype is 10-13x faster than a 2.5 GHz quad-core Xeon, and 1.5-5x faster than a 240 core 1.3 GHz Tesla GPU, despite operating at a modest frequency of 125 MHz.","","978-1-4577-1213-5","10.1109/SASP.2011.5941090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5941090","","Field programmable gate arrays;Digital signal processing;Parallel processing;Semantics;Arrays;System-on-a-chip;Random access memory","","1","","14","IEEE","7 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and resource consumption for hardware implementations of frame synchronization modules able to support the satellite communication protocol defined by the standard CCSDS 131.2-B-1, and we define the hardware architecture corresponding to the best solution. In order to support high data-rate links, we illustrate also the methodology to derive a parallel implementation that allows increasing throughput without replicating all the hardware resources. We also verified such architectures by means of RTL simulations of a corresponding bit-true model written in VHDL.

Consequently, bugs in code optimization will inevitably cast significant impact on the correctness of software systems. Locating optimization bugs in compilers is challenging as compilers typically support a large amount of optimization configurations. Although prior studies have proposed to locate compiler bugs via generating witness test programs, they are still time-consuming and not effective enough. To address such limitations, we propose an automatic bug localization approach, ODFL, for locating compiler optimization bugs via differentiating finer-grained options in this study. Specifically, we first disable the fine-grained options that are enabled by default under the bug-triggering optimization levels independently to obtain bug-free and bug-related fine-grained options. We then configure several effective passing and failing optimization sequences based on such fine-grained options to obtain multiple failing and passing compiler coverage. Finally, such generated coverage information can be utilized via Spectrum-Based Fault Localization formulae to rank the suspicious compiler files. We run ODFL on 60 buggy GCC compilers from an existing benchmark. The experimental results show that ODFL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art compiler bug isolation approach RecBi in terms of all the evaluated metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of ODFL. In addition, ODFL is much more efficient than RecBi as it can save more than 88% of the time for locating bugs on average.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00065","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072194,61772259,62002125); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825818","Compiler;Bug Isolation;Fault Localization;Finer-grained;Optimization Option","Location awareness;Measurement;Codes;Program processors;Conferences;Computer bugs;Benchmark testing","","3","","41","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The modular sub-blocks are arranged in a controlled flow-through, pipelined scheme to eliminate global connections and maintain linear performance scaling and high throughput. Modularity also enables energy savings via deactivation of unused I/O wires.

"Trace Link Evolution across Multiple Software Versions in Safety-Critical Systems","M.

It is an essential element in the software development process, especially for Safety-Critical systems where trace links are used to demonstrate that all hazards and faults are mitigated in the delivered system. Maintaining trace links as a software system evolves over time is difficult, error-prone and costly. As a result, trace links tend to become outdated and safety-cases, which rely on trace links and associated data to compose arguments and evidence for system safety are invalidated. In practice, soft-ware developers must therefore painstakingly update trace links in order to re-validate safety-cases whenever they seek re-certification of their product. While a significant body of work exists in the area of trace link creation, very limited research has focused on the problem of link evolution. The goal of this dissertation is therefore to deliver an accurate,scalable, and practical approach for supporting trace link evolution across a diverse set of software artifacts including requirements, source code and safety cases.","","978-1-4503-4205-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883424","Software Evolution;Maintenance;Safety-Critical Systems","Hazards;Software systems;Maintenance engineering;Software engineering;Semantics","","1","","20","","23 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the complexity of data centers or telecommunication networks increases, managing such infrastructures involves large amounts of data originating from many and diverse sources. In a typical IT management infrastructure, we find many management components such as commercial and open source products (e.g., for monitoring); custom, be-spoke software (e.g., a home-grown inventory database) as well as additional conventional (e.g., calendar) and unconventional (e.g., Web forums, blogs) data sources. The amount of information and the number of tools that are at the disposal of the system operator for management tasks are both wide-ranging and overwhelming. Finding the set of information and tools that is relevant to solve a given problem is a challenge, and typically requires expertise in how to extract data from the available data sources and how to use that extracted data effectively. A search facility that can locate data and tools is beneficial to systems management, but to maximize its impact, it needs to address the heterogeneity of data and data sources; provide task-focused, structured and enriched results, and be both scalable and cost-effective in the dynamic and changing environment of today's IT infrastructures. This paper describes such a system, called Fusio, that provides a search capability based on a loose coupling of heterogeneous, systems-management-related data in an IT environment. Fusio is based on the Semantic Web and traditional information-retrieval technologies. Tools such as Fusio are useful for system operators in carrying out tasks, such as problem resolution, where pointers to related information and tools can be quickly found to speed up the task. They are also useful for training purposes, e.g., as a reference to available data and tools. The paper describes the architecture of the search facility and the prototype implementation that is now being deployed in a test environment.","2374-9709","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488379","","Search engines;Inventory management;Data mining;Telecommunication network management;Monitoring;Open source software;Databases;Calendars;Blogs;Waste management","","2","","14","IEEE","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work explores the structural congruence between BN and SBN (in terms of software data structure) and a semantic bijection between Subjective Logic opinions to Dirichlet distributions to introduce a SBN reasoning framework that targets on effectively reusing the existing BN solutions. Particularly, we developed two inference algorithms that apply a Monte Carlo method to existing BN inference algorithms (we chose the Junction Tree algorithm, for test), respectively for batch and interactive SBN reasoning. A method for translating an evidence in SBN to uncertain (virtual) evidence in BN is also presented. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a simple, yet flexible empirical estimation method and a software architecture that virtually adapts any BN inference algorithm to an approximate computational inference framework for SBN.

It finds information designs in the informational index by learning customers decisions and produces the results that co-identifies with their requirements. Real time examples like Amazon, have been using a recommendation engine for suggesting the goods or products that customers might also like. As the database used in this paper consists of large amount of data, it becomes a difficult and cumbersome process to provide viable choice of products for all the customers. The need of state of art recommendation engine is a necessity in real world e-commerce platforms to solve the issue and fulfil the customers’ needs. There are numerous ways such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid filtering, etc. to build a recommendation system. This paper developed a product recommendation engine that uses collaborative filtering approach, which finds similarity between items bought by the customers with other customers, purchase pattern, and association rule mining framework. The recommendations were generated in order to facilitate ‘cross-sell’ across various items. The collaborative filtering (CF) approach produced the top 10 recommendations for each user. The association rule mining produced the rules based on minimum support (at 0.001) and minimum confidence (at 0.8) values. These values produced around 40,000 viable rules. It can be inferred that selection of metrics and the computation speed is important for quality recommendations.","","978-1-7281-2813-9","10.1109/ICISC47916.2020.9171210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171210","Association rule mining;Item-based CF;Collaborative filtering;User-based CF;Recommendation engine","Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Databases;Collaborative filtering;Filtering algorithms;Real-time systems;Information filtering","","8","","14","IEEE","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applying UPROM notation, process and guidelines to implement these practices in an integrated way, a set of models are developed that can be used to generate related artifacts. As one of the artifacts, UPROM tool is used to automatically estimate the early COSMIC functional size conforming to UPROM FSE method. The procedures and rules of UPROM FSE method are described in this paper.

However, one of the main gaps is the difficulty of measuring the energy consumption when software is executed in order to detect, for example, parts of the software with excessive energy consumption. For that reason, a Framework for Energy Efficiency Testing to Improve eNviromental Goals of the Software (FEETINGS) has been proposed. In this paper, we focus on the core of the framework, that is, the Energy Efficiency Tester (EET), which is the measurement hardware device devoted to collecting the specific consumption data of the software under evaluation. The architecture and the main functions of EET, along with the reliability validation done with it are presented here, as well as an analysis of the data extracted from a case study conducted. The outcome of such analysis shows that EET is able to carry out stable energy consumption measurements of executed software.","","978-1-4503-5732-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449823","Software consumption measurement;Green software;Software sustainability;measurement device","Software;Energy measurement;Software measurement;Energy consumption;Hardware;Green products;Energy efficiency","","1","","14","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the spatial compression technique is essential in the uplink receiver structure. In this work, the fronthaul-constrained uplink CU-DU structure is fully discussed and the performance of two alternatives, closed-loop and open-loop spatial compression, are evaluated and compared with 2D cross-polarized antenna arrays.

The app follows closely the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale which is the most commonly used protocol in the clinical study of PD; can be used by patients and their carers at home or in the community; and, requires the user to perform a sequence of iterated movements which are recorded by the phone sensors. This paper discusses how the cloudUPDRS system addresses two key challenges towards meeting essential consistency and efficiency requirements, namely: (i) How to ensure high-quality data collection especially considering the unsupervised nature of the test, in particular, how to achieve firm user adherence to the prescribed movements; and (ii) How to reduce test duration from approximately 25 minutes typically required by an experienced patient, to below 4 minutes, a threshold identified as critical to obtain significant improvements in clinical compliance. To address the former, we combine a bespoke design of the user experience tailored so as to constrain context, with a deep learning approach used to identify failures to follow the movement protocol while at the same time limiting false positives to avoid unnecessary repetition. We address the latter by developing a machine learning approach to personalise assessments by selecting those elements of the UPDRS protocol that most closely match individual symptom profiles and thus offer the highest inferential power hence closely estimating the patent's overall UPRDS score.","2474-249X","978-1-5090-4327-9","10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917848","","Diseases;Sensors;Conferences;Pervasive computing;Machine learning;Protocols;Market research","","35","","53","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, based on our empirical measurements in different measurement scenarios, carefully created to closely correspond to real usage models, we show that low-complexity UWB Rakes have the potential to be considered as serious competitor to OFDM and SC-FDE for the future 60 GHz transceiver technology. Performance evaluation is realized by semi-analytical bit error rate analyses of different Rake architectures considering high data rate modulations. We show that low-complexity Rake receiver schemes are capable to provide sufficient performance using both standard-defined 64-QAM and ultra-wideband impulse radio signaling with 64-PPM and 64-PAM. The study is realized through the spectrum from 54 to 66 GHz and the effect of the carrier frequency on the performance is also discussed.","","978-1-4673-8167-3","10.1109/RTSI.2015.7325077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325077","","Bit error rate;Signal to noise ratio;OFDM;Modulation;Fading;Receivers;Multipath channels","","4","","21","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes Lean Contrastive Divergence (LCD), a modified Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm, to accelerate RBM learning and prediction without changing the results. LCD avoids most of the required computations with two optimization techniques. The first is called bounds-based filtering, which, through triangle inequality, replaces expensive calculations of many vector dot products with fast bounds calculations. The second is delta product, which effectively detects and avoids many repeated calculations in the core operation of RBM, Gibbs Sampling. The optimizations are applicable to both the standard contrastive divergence learning algorithm and its variations. Results show that the optimizations can produce several-fold (up to 3X for training and 5.3X for prediction) speedups.","2374-8486","978-1-5386-3835-4","10.1109/ICDM.2017.131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215594","","Optimization;Training;Liquid crystal displays;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms;Probability;Computer science","","2","","18","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method reorganizes the ways of set-associative arrays caches into partitions with different line sizes and defines array-partition mappings so as to minimize the average memory access energy-delay product. Experimental results have shown that these split array caches have lower average energy-delay product for memory accesses as compared with unified set-associative array caches of the same size. For an MPEG-2 decoder, even with no parallel accesses to cache partitions, the average memory access energy-delay product of an 8K-byte trace-based split array cache is reduced by 50% as compared to that of the unified set-associative array cache with the lowest energy-delay product. If 25% of the accesses occur in pairs, there is an additional reduction of 9%.","","978-1-4244-7839-2","10.1109/DSD.2010.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615611","embedded cache design;trace-based design algorithm;embedded system design;design space exploration","Arrays;Transform coding;Design methodology;Energy consumption;Mathematical model;Equations;Measurement","","","","30","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Deep Learning Model for Identification of Defect Patterns in Semiconductor Wafer Map","Y.

Each layer must be inspected of defect after drawing and baking the mask pattern in wafer fabrication. Unfortunately, the defects come from various variations during the semiconductor manufacturing and cause massive losses to the companies' yield. If the defects could be identified and classified correctly, then the root of the fabrication problem can be recognized and eventually resolved. Automatic optical inspection (AOI) is used to visualize defect patterns and identify root causes of die failures. AOI can be replaced a large number of human inspections with high-speed and accurate inspection technology, to achieve consistency in the detection and shorten the inspection time, then improve product quality and competitiveness. The defect is judged from the feature in AOI, but the final goal is to determine if the defect is a true or a pseudo defect of the wafer. Then, we need to determine what defect type is. But the current AOI needs a subsequent final verification by the human to judge the type of defect. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely accepted and are well suited for such classification and identification problems. In this paper, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for wafer map retrieval tasks and the defect pattern classification. CNN is the most famous deep learning architecture. The recent surge of interest in CNN is due to the immense popularity and effectiveness of convnets. XGBoost is the most popular machine learning framework among data science practitioners, especially on Kaggle, which is a platform for data prediction competitions where researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models. CNN and XGBoost are compared with a random decision forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting (Adaboost), and the final results indicate a superior classification performance of the proposed method. Our experimental result demonstrates the success of CNN and extreme gradient boosting techniques for the identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafers. The overall classification accuracy for the test dataset of CNN and extreme gradient boosting is 99.2%/98.1%. We demonstrate the success of this technique for the identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafers. We believe this is the first time accurate computational classification in such task has been reported achieving accuracy above 99%.","2376-6697","978-1-5386-7601-1","10.1109/ASMC.2019.8791815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8791815","","Feature extraction;Boosting;Task analysis;Support vector machines;Manufacturing;Inspection;Data models","","33","","31","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scientific applications, weather forecasting, researches, hospitals, military services are few such major contributors. As the amount of data increases, the need to provide efficient, easy to use solutions has become one of the main issues for these type of computations. The best solution to this issue is the use of Distributed File Systems(DFS). Some existing Distributed File Systems are too complex to deploy and maintain, although they are extremely scalable and cheap since they can be entirely built out of commodity Operating System(OS) and hardware. GlusterFS solves this problem. Gluster File System(GFS) is open source and is capable of scaling to several petabytes(upto 72 brontobytes) and handling thousands of clients. It is based on a stackable user space design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. GlusterFS is an easy to use clustered file system that meets enterprise-level requirements. It is written in user space which uses FUSE(Filesystem in user space) to hook itself with the VFS layer. It takes a layered approach to the file system, where features are added/removed as per the requirement. Enforcer is a major component in Gluster which finds its extensive use in production. Enforcer is concerned more about limits. It helps to restrict the usage(both in terms of size and count) at directory or volume level in the file system. In this paper, we discuss the internal working of the translators and key architectural components of GlusterFS. Along with that, one can gain a deep insight about the enforcement techniques, few challenges, undergoing researches and projects of GlusterFS.","","978-1-5090-3951-7","10.1109/ICCCRI.2016.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7600187","Distributed File System(DFS);Gluster File System(","Metadata;Scalability;Distributed databases;Servers;Hardware;Synchronization;Redundancy","","9","","6","IEEE","20 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although a great deal of theoretical work on Architectural Technical Debt has been undertaken, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the negative effects of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development lifecycle. The aim of this study is to investigate how practitioners perceive and estimate the impact of Architectural Technical Debt during the software development process. This paper reports the results of an online web survey providing quantitative data from 258 participants. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it shows that practitioners experience that the Architectural type of Technical Debt has the highest negative impact on daily software development work. Secondly, we provide evidence that does not support the commonly held belief that Architectural Technical Debt increases with the age of the software. Thirdly, we show that despite different responsibilities and working tasks of software professionals, Architectural Technical Debt negatively affects all roles without any significant difference between the roles.","","978-1-5386-2141-7","10.1109/SEAA.2017.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051360","component;Architectural Technical Debt;Wasted time;Software Age;Software Roles;Software Development;Empirical Study;Survey;Quantitative data","Maintenance engineering;Computer architecture;Computer science;Software quality;Industries;Focusing","","4","","37","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the information is concise and informative, there is certainly room for expansion and further elaboration on the topic. To begin with, software testing is a critical component of the software development process. It involves the evaluation of software to ensure that it meets specific requirements, functions correctly, and is free of defects. The role of testing is to identify potential issues or errors in the software before it is released to end-users. There are various methods and models used in engineering testing of data processing software. Each of these methods focuses on a specific aspect of the software and aims to identify potential issues at different stages of development. In addition to testing methods, it is essential to have a structured testing process in place. Moreover, it is necessary to evaluate the testing process to determine its effectiveness and identify areas that may need improvement. Overall, software testing is a complex process that requires careful planning, execution, and evaluation. It is essential to use appropriate testing methods and models to ensure that software meets its intended purpose and functions correctly.

We present our Scientific Applications case study in the context of reliable scientific research and the validation of results from scientific articles. We describe our experience creating scientific applications and their evolution from simple Demo or non-reproducible artifacts to completely verifiable apps. We analyze common patterns in the creation of scientific applications, discussing the benefits and difficulties encountered that lead to the proposed OVDSaaS features. In this context, four applications were developed for breathing analysis, clinical tumor segmentation, legal assistance, and smart grids, supported in ML/ AI scientific fields such as signal processing, image processing, and NLP.

The information generated through the manufacturing process, including certificates and inspection results, is registered and thus trackable. In the shipbuilding industry, the process of building a ship is complex, has several stages, and it is important to guarantee high-quality levels during the manufacturing process. For this, the methods and technologies adopted for process traceability must be selected, having in mind the specific requirements and constraints of the shipbuilding industry in the most efficient way. In addition, process traceability may add value to the ship, as all the traceable information may be easily transferred to the end customer. This way, the customer can have the information of any material, component, part, and block of the ship easily and reliably, as well as all the certificates and documents necessary for any process. This paper proposes a blockchain-based system architecture that fosters the traceability of the production processes applied to the shipbuilding industry based on the West Sea Viana Shipyards. The system will be implemented as a case study in the manufacturing process of a shipbuilding block, and therefore readily extendable to the overall ship manufacturing process. The blockchain-based system will contain or refer to all relevant documents (certificates, warranties, etc.) and other pertinent manufacturing data that can be delivered to the customer together with the ship, thus increasing trustability.","2166-0727","978-9-8933-3436-2","10.23919/CISTI54924.2022.9820491","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820491","Blockchain;IoT;Shipbuilding Industry;Traceability;Industry 5.0","Warranties;Manufacturing processes;Shipbuilding industry;Systems architecture;Production;Materials reliability;Inspection","","3","","8","","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As these data rates exceed hundreds of megahertz and the physical complexity of the transmission channel increase, it may no longer be sufficient to ensure only the frequency dependency of channel models. Rather, the model developer must guarantee the model response is passive and causal. This is of particular interest given that non-causal models may not allow convergence or yield accurate channel loss within industry-standard tool suites, even though it's response may yield reasonable correlation to measured scattering parameters. Therefore, model developers must understand how the model creation, checking and simulation tools work together to ensure validity of transient simulations. Commercially-available tools exist that provide numerical and visual interpretation of causality compliance (or violation) for any given touchstone model. It is critical, however, for the model developer to understand the verification process used within a chosen tool suite and how to interpret results. Moreover, model developers must know how model frequency content, step size, length and other parameters may impact a checking tool's ability to accurately flag causality violations. As a result, the developer must have an in-depth understanding of the correlation between model content and causality error reporting, whether or not violations raise real concerns and if so, how they may impact the results obtained from the system-level simulation methodology. This paper will discuss the interaction between the model development process, the ability to verify model causality and the impact at the link or system-level as a result of non-causal models or inaccurate interpretation of causality-checking verification tools.","2377-5726","978-1-61284-498-5","10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5898556","","Scattering parameters;Channel models;Transforms;Numerical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Data models;Dielectrics","","2","","7","IEEE","20 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we explore approximate computing for a key computation pattern, Reduce-and-Rank (RnR), which is prevalent in a wide range of workloads including video processing, recognition, search and data mining. An RnR kernel performs a reduction operation (e.g., distance computation, dot product, L1-norm) between an input vector and each of a set of reference vectors, and ranks the reduction outputs to select the top reference vectors for the current input. We propose two complementary approximation strategies for the RnR computation pattern. The first is interleaved reduction-and-ranking, wherein the vector reductions are decomposed into multiple partial reductions and interleaved with the rank computation. Leveraging this transformation, we propose the use of intermediate reduction results and ranks to identify future computations that are likely to have low impact on the output, and can hence be approximated. The second strategy, input similarity based approximation, exploits the spatial or temporal correlation of inputs (e.g., pixels of an image or frames of a video) to identify computations that are amenable to approximation. These strategies address a key challenge in approximate computing - identification of which computations to approximate - and may be used to drive any approximation mechanism such as computation skipping and precision scaling to realize performance or energy improvements. A second key challenge in approximate computing is that the extent to which computations can be approximated varies significantly from application to application, and across inputs for even a single application. Hence, quality configurability, or the ability to automatically modulate the degree of approximation at runtime is essential. To enable quality configurability in RnR kernels, we propose a kernel-level quality metric that correlates well to application-level quality, and identify key parameters that can be used to tune the proposed approximation strategies dynamically. We develop a runtime framework that modulates the identified parameters during execution of RnR kernels to minimize their energy while meeting a given target quality. To evaluate the proposed concepts, we designed quality-configurable hardware implementations of 6 RnR-based applications from the recognition, mining, search and video processing application domains in 45nm technology. Our experiments demonstrate 1.06X-2.18X reduction in energy consumption with virtually no loss in output quality (<;0.5%) at the application-level. The energy benefits further improve up to 2.38X and 2.5X when the quality constraints are relaxed to 2.5% and 5% respectively.","1558-1101","978-3-9815-3705-5","10.7873/DATE.2015.0569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092472","","Approximation methods;Kernel;Correlation;Calibration;Approximation algorithms;Training","","15","1","19","","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, expansions of memory and cache can potentially increase manufacturing costs beyond what can be recovered through use phase advantages for reasonable usage patterns. With this holistic view of sustainability in mind, we provide evaluations of the environmental impacts of memory and cache options for Parsec and SPEC multi-program workloads. Using indifference point analysis, we determine which architectural decisions are the most sustainable in the context of these workloads for various usage scenarios. Through a form of break even analysis, we show the impact of upgrading to a new technology node. Our analysis of current processor trends indicates that upgrading may require upwards of 10 years of service time to break even, and that designing systems with smaller cache and main memory sizes may provide an overall positive environmental trend without dramatically reducing performance.","","978-1-5090-5117-5","10.1109/IGCC.2016.7892605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892605","","Integrated circuits;Market research;Green products;Computer architecture;Fabrication;Lithography","","12","","28","IEEE","6 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of sequence modeling often ignores the heterogeneity of EHRs. In other words, it only considers historical diagnoses and does not incorporate patient demographics, which correspond to clinically essential context, into the sequence modeling. To address the issue, we aim at investigating the use of an attention mechanism that is tailored to medical context to predict a future diagnosis.

The novel attention mechanism utilizes the derived individual patient information from conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs).

This compressor offers high performance at the cost of a decrease in accuracy. The 130nm, 32nm CMOS and 32nm CNTFET technologies are used to implement the 4–2 compressor. Since there is no best approximation compressor, the optimal compressor relies on the level of precision needed by the customer. The complete adder is the most popular compressor out of all of them. This proposed 4–2 compressor is a reduction in both the space and the power of the compressor after researching other compressors. The and gate of the proposed circuit is one less than that of an existing compressor. In general, the proposed 4–2 compressor uses less electricity. Measured variables include delay, the power-delay product, and the average of the powers. The HSPICE tool is used to perform simulations. These implementations also make the system's design, delay, power usage, and complexity less difficult. For many applications, multiplication is a crucial arithmetic operation. The approximation compressor is a crucial component for creating a power-efficient approximate multiplier. For computer techniques that call for faster performance and lower power computations, approximate multiplication is a frequently used operation. Using simulation data to assess the 4–2 compressor's overall performance, it is found that the compressor has improved. Applications for image processing can use this proposed compressor to construct multipliers.","","979-8-3503-3742-6","10.1109/RAEEUCCI57140.2023.10134395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10134395","Synopsys HSpice Tool;CMOS gates;High-Speed VLSI Architecture;CosmosScope Tool","Image coding;Costs;Computational modeling;Logic gates;Very large scale integration;CMOS technology;Delays","","2","","18","IEEE","30 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fixing the test algorithm during the design phase may not be compatible with this goal, as unexpected failures not covered by this algorithm may be occur during production. Also, having the possibility to select the memory test algorithm after fabrication is very important during the initial phase of a new process node (both process debug and production ramp-up).

Recently, applying deep learning models to generate layouts has attracted increasing attention. This paper focuses on using the GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster graphic layouts, which requires an advertising poster layout dataset with paired product images and graphic layouts. However, the paired images and layouts in the existing dataset are collected by inpainting and annotating posters, respectively. There exists a domain gap between inpainted posters (source domain data) and clean product images (target domain data). Therefore, this paper combines unsupervised domain adaption techniques to design a GAN with a novel pixel-level discriminator (PD), called PDA-GAN, to generate graphic layouts according to image contents. The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDAGAN can achieve state-of-the-art performances and generate high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertising posters.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-0129-8","10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.00975","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10204449","Image and video synthesis and generation","Deep learning;Computer vision;Adaptation models;Boolean functions;Layout;Data structures;Pattern recognition","","8","","35","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a test and diagnostic system model that provides a means to use historical test and repair data from all levels of operation. The process reduces rework costs and decreases maintenance and repair costs through earlier and more accurate fault isolation. This work recoups the efforts of the original developer and captures test and diagnostic knowledge for the future. Consequently, the concept has been proposed for implementation within the Army ATS/TPS centers for use at the Army maintenance depots. Additional benefits from this work: development of a reliability database for system, subsystem, component by test type and ATS; tracking system reliability and mission performance data for use in developing requirements for new or upgrade system procurement specifications; and for pushing diagnostic knowledge and support from the sustainment level to the field and vice versa.

Aims: Change Impact Analysis (CIA) refers to the identification of source code files impacted when implementing a change request. We extend this question to predict not only affected files, but also the effort needed for implementing the change, and the duration necessary for that. Method: This study evaluates the performance of three textual similarity techniques for CIA based on Bag of words in combination with either topic modeling or file coupling. Results: The approaches are applied on data from two industrial projects. The data comes as part of an industrial collaboration project with Brightsquid, a Canadian start-up company specializing in secure communication solutions. Performance analysis shows that combining textual similarity with file coupling improves impact prediction, resulting in Recall of 67%. Effort and duration can be predicted with 84% and 72% accuracy using textual similarity only. Conclusions: The relative effort invested into CIA for predicting impacted files can be reduced by extending its applicability to multiple dimensions which include impacted files, effort, and duration.","","978-1-5090-4039-1","10.1109/ESEM.2017.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8170093","Change Impact Analysis;Case Study;Software Repository;Topic Modeling;Bag of Words;Effort estimation","Software;Couplings;Dentistry;Predictive models;Postal services;Companies;Collaboration","","2","","29","IEEE","11 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to improve computer performance is an important part of the computer overall design. In general processors, multiplication components play a decisive role in processor's performance. An important and frequent operation in decimal computations is multiplication. However, due to the inherent inefficiency of decimal arithmetic implementations in binary logic, practically all the proposed decimal multipliers are sequential units. Binary computing couldn't be avoided of conversion efficiency lowly and loss of accuracy. In this paper direct expanding the decimal computing applications and binary can't meet the needs of decimal operations, according to this new standard IEEE-754r, use SOPC technology design and implement a new architecture based on the decimal floating-point multiplication unit. This design takes advantage of flexibility and low-power of SOPC, the independence of IP core and so on; it is packaged as an independent IP core. This decimal floating-point multiplication unit is broadly applications in the general processors, portable devices, and mass data processing and so on. It uses Signed-Digit radix-4 algorithm and new BCD coding techniques for the decomposition of decimal floating-point computing. and compared with the common single-precision binary floating-point unit, it was wider computing, higher accuracy, faster computing speed and wider application. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) Customized a 32/64 bit fully functional decimal floating point multiplication IP core; (2) Improved partial products based on the BCD-8421 and revised parts of the circuit; (3) According to the customized component operational requirements, defined a way of data bus, caused decimal floating point multiplication unit is good access SOPC system bus.

The DSL approach is in stark contrast to that of a general programming language that attempts to provide a means to represent solutions for a broad range of problems. DSLs may incorporate constructs and syntactical features that not only relate to the problem context, but also to the execution platform. DSLs thus provide a potential for reducing development time and thereby cutting business costs. At present this approach is likely more appropriate to prototyping and rapid experimental work; but as technologies to implement DSLs improve they may become more beneficial and cost effective for developing marketable products. In this paper we present a DSL, called OptiSDR, aimed to improve developer productivity for development of software defined radio (SDR) applications deployed on heterogeneous computing architectures (HCAs). OptiSDR is designed for HCAs that adhere to certain combinations of processing devices, namely FPGAs, graphics processing units, and multi-core general purpose processors. Our aim to improve developer productivity in multiple ways was achieved, with development cycles for parallel DSP routines for SDR reduced to few hours as opposed to days for CUDA-C development cycles. OptiSDR uses automatic code generation for structured parallel SDR patterns, and performs automatic profiling to generate faster execution kernels with speed-ups of more than 50× compared to other sequential implementations while reducing manual effort in porting and tuning code. Therefore this paper reports on a study confirming the potential to speed up when using OptiSDR for prototyping SDR applications.","","978-1-5090-0706-6","10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737304","","DSL;Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Computer languages;Graphics processing units;Programming","","","","11","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection.

"Automatic Generation of Modular Multipliers Upon Pseudo-Mersenne Primes Using DSP Blocks on FPGAs","S. Harish S; D. B.

Execution in ECC primarily requires multiplication and addition in $GF(p)$. On the other hand, homomorphic encryption, a cryptographic technique that allows arithmetic operations over encrypted data, requires addition and multiplication in ring $R_{q}=Z_{q}[x]/(x^{n}+1)$, which in turn requires coefficient multiplication over the integer $q$. Efforts to enhance the efficiency of modular multipliers have been extensively pursued due to the pivotal role they play in the critical path of various cryptographic operations. In recent times, FPGA boards containing DSP blocks which are capable of efficiently performing various mathematical operations stood out to be a desirable platform to design modular multipliers. But designing multipliers over FPG As stands tricky as the operand sizes supported by the DSPs are asymmetric in nature. In this paper, we propose an automated multiplier design technique that facilitates the design of modular multipliers upon pseudo-Mersenne primes. Our proposed automated multiplier design tool generates efficient hardware architectures of modular multipliers with pseudo-Mersenne primes that can be directly used in RNS (residue number system) and cryptographic algorithms like ECC in GF(p). Using the tool, we generated modular multiplier designs for various primes supporting several elliptic curves and for several RNS systems supporting a large prime. Our tool-generated hardware implementations' resource requirements regarding critical path delay and resource utilization are significantly more efficient than those of existing implementations.","2771-2508","979-8-3503-8038-5","10.1109/DSD64264.2024.00028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10741729","Modular Multiplication;FPGA;DSP;Cryptography","Elliptic curves;Digital systems;Elliptic curve cryptography;Hardware;Design tools;Delays;Cryptography;Resource management;Homomorphic encryption;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","12","IEEE","6 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such losses and uncertainty in the amount of energy transferred to the drill bit can impair an operator's ability to achieve cost-effectiveness and to optimize performance. The paper describes a memory-based, modular device that can reside inside a drill bit without altering bottomhole assembly (BHA) stiffness and hydraulic requirements.

Premise to achieve this objective is up-to-date information on all levels of a factory and during the product life cycle, so that men and machine can optimize their activities according to their tasks. One approach to implement this economically is the massive application of sensors and information and communication technologies (ICT) leading to a Smart Factory. This process and related applications are summarized under the term of the forth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0). It demands a flexible and easy-to-use integration of assets on the shop floor with ICT systems. The contribution of this paper is an Manufacturing Integration Assistant (MIALinx) that enables all these steps. The steps range from the integration to the sensing and analyzing of the sensor data to the execution of required actions. Furthermore, MIALinx provides an abstract rule based approach for users to model the behavior of the system. The presented system is based on concepts and technologies of the Internet of Things and service-oriented middleware. The main users targeted with our system are small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the expertise or the investment possibilities to invest in completely new Industrie 4.0 systems but rather use their existing production assets and enrich them to achieve Industrie 4.0 capability.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397529","Rules;Integration;Manufacturing;Smart Factory;Industrie 4.0;Manufacturing Service Bus","Sensors;Actuators;Manufacturing;Maintenance engineering;Production facilities;Fans","","6","","30","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SoS serves to distinguish true multi-domain and multi-discipline systems from others who have taken up the systems mantle, most noticeably software and IT spaces. But SoS is more than just a higher level focus on configuration management (CM), requirements management (RM), data management strategies (CMS) and integrated logistics support (ILS). These factors are primarily concerned with the mechanics of data handling. SoS deals with the process of work-in-progress and how the design drives the implementation. The design is the guiding element for the system or product. This paper will distill the process, design and implementation issues that distinguish Systems-of-Systems from subsystems and domain-specific systems. These differentiated factors will be illustrated in case studies that focus on safety-critical processes common in aviation, rail, road and automotive development. For example, one commonly required is the need to gauge process maturity as found in the CMMI, Automotive Spice, Aviation ARP4754A and, more recently, the automotive ISO-26262 “Fitfor-Purpose” certifications. All of these strive to measure the worthiness of hardware-software systems. All such systems are in fact assembled from other systems, thus creating true `system of systems' final implemented products. Without consideration of the system of systems aspects from the initial inception throughout the design flow, such systems inevitably experience numerous iterations, regulatory challenges and delivery delays. By paying appropriate attention to the full broader set of issues - through effectively applying systems engineering approaches and relevant standards from the concept through design and into implementation and delivery, critical improvements in process and product lead to successful results.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753176","Systems Engineering;System of Systems;process;design;safety-critical;standards","System of systems;Automobiles;Safety;Software;Automotive engineering;Standards;Tire pressure","","2","","7","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The work is partially inspired on current neuroscience hypotheses about the control of the human arm and the computational processes used by the brain. A first experiment uses inspiration from the classical neuroscience experiment of the Waiter Task. In the original experiment, the non-dominant human arm is holding a weight of 1 Kg. When this weight is unloaded by a self-generated action (with the dominant arm), it is observed that the non-dominant arm does not suffer perceptible postural changes. The reason arguably stems from the prediction of the forces occurring at the unloading, since the inherently delayed sensory feedback present in biological systems would not suffice to react in such a short notice as observed. The experiment is reproduced in a robotic platform by means of forward models and compliance adaption via stiffness control as speculated in neuroscience hypotheses. A second experiment uses context-based predictions to modify on-line the compliance of the robot manipulator. For this task, a Bayesian predictor in the form of a Relevance Vector Machine combines the use of prior knowledge and expected sensory feedback to correct for an erroneous compliance in the case of a falsely-predicted context. The results are combined in an architecture called Predictive Context-Based Adaptive Compliance (PCAC).","2153-0866","978-1-61284-456-5","10.1109/IROS.2011.6094476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6094476","","Robot sensing systems;Context;Dairy products;Impedance;Humans;Bayesian methods","","1","","17","IEEE","5 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its benefits are particularly beneficial for businesses at times of economic crisis. Factors such as rising R&D costs, decreasing product life span, globalized competition, and rapid changes in the technological industry including the environment since the 1990s, has caused businesses to form alliances against competition. Therefore, industry clustering is an essential core capability. This study uses high-quality human resources, technical infrastructures, knowledge resources, and capital resources described by Porter (1990) [20]as criteria for the formation of industry clusters and as elements to evaluate its effects. Previous studies have examined clustering in regional economics and urban planning. Therefore information on the effects of clustering and its implications for business management is limited. This study investigates the relationship between industry clustering and business performance by empirical research and analysis. And thus stimulate the motivation of this study, the study results can help enterprises set up factories in the decision-making reference basis. In addition, problems in the Hsinchu and Tainan Science Parks and the magnitude of its clustering effect are verified by location quotient analysis. A model for evaluating manufacturer's efficiency is constructed by data envelopment analysis (DEA). Sensitivity analysis is used to determine the order of importance for the criteria of industry cluster formation. This study shows that as the effects of clustering increases, the performance of those manufacturers in the cluster becomes more substantial. Furthermore, the size of businesses is the most significant factor which influences the effects of clustering. The sensitivity analysis results can be observed in the industrial clusters of the elements of the performance impact on the solar industry Sort order: capital, high-quality personnel, R & D expenditures, machinery and equipment investment.

The possibility of attacking targets using a group of UAVs increases the relevance of protection measures, particularly camouflage. The literature review highlights the experience of using UAVs in military spheres of activity and their high efficiency in reconnaissance and support on the battlefield. Using high-resolution images, visual orientation on the terrain was considered a priority direction of UAV navigation in the operation of electronic warfare tools. Based on hybrid convolutional neural networks, hardware for working with the UAV platform is serially produced. Vines are suggested for masking stationary objects due to their rapid growth and the corresponding quality/cost ratio. The work aims to check the effectiveness of masking small objects using grassy and climbing (lianas) vegetation concerning the prospects of their identification by optical means. The research was conducted using our data obtained from UAVs in the visible range on experimental fields and the botanical hall of NUBiP of Ukraine and on pictures of buildings from the Internet. It has been experimentally established that vegetation's variety of shapes, sizes, and structures complicates the recognition process for convolutional neural networks. The appearance of plants can change significantly depending on the angle of photography, lighting, and the state of mineral nutrition. Organic camouflage in the form of grasses and vines can entirely or partially hide buildings and structures, changing their brightness and contour. This can obscure details and increase the risk of false object recognition. For example, facilities covered with ARISTOLOCHIA MANSHURIENSIS Kom vines were correctly recognized only 27% of the time using neural networks. Convolutional neural networks require a large amount of data to train if the goal is to achieve high accuracy. However, if data with vine-covered objects is limited or unavailable, the training process may need to be improved, affecting the network's ability to recognize such things accurately.","","979-8-3503-9515-0","10.1109/MSNMC61017.2023.10328960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10328960","organic camouflage;UAV;convolutional neural networks;monitoring;RGB","Training;Navigation;Buildings;Neural networks;Vegetation mapping;Reconnaissance;Autonomous aerial vehicles","","2","","21","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, they cannot be secured using conventional security protocols that are already developed. Hence, lightweight implementations of IoT security are the need of the hour. This paper proposes a secure and tamper-resistant system for monitoring the status of items in a container during transportation and storage using IoT devices. As smart logistics often transport items that are sensitive to environmental changes such as temperature and humidity, the security of data obtained from these sensors is the main focus of this research. To evaluate the performance of the system, a pilot-scale silo has been fabricated. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is used as the communication protocol and a lightweight implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol has been adapted for the smart container architecture to incorporate cryptographic security. The low power consumption of the lightweight DTLS-secured CoAP implementation will drastically increase the efficiency of the smart logistics architecture without compromising its security.","","978-1-6654-8294-3","10.1109/IMTIC53841.2021.9719796","Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan; University of Engineering & Technology (UET) Peshawar(grant numbers:2(1078)/HEC/M&E/2018/707); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9719796","IoT Devices Security;Secured Smart Logistics;CoAP;DTLS;Intelligent Container;Real-Time Monitoring","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Containers;Internet of Things","","","","16","IEEE","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While significant improvements have been achieved for deep feature representation learning, traditional SVM/softmax classifiers remain the dominant methods for the final object category classification. However, SVM/softmax classifiers lack the capacity of explicitly exploiting the complex structure of deep features, as they are purely discriminative methods. The recently proposed discriminative dictionary pair learning (DPL) model involves a fidelity term to minimize the reconstruction loss and a discrimination term to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned dictionary pair, and thus is appropriate for balancing the representation and discrimination to boost object detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel object detection system by unifying DPL with the convolutional feature learning. Specifically, we incorporate DPL as a Dictionary Pair Classifier Layer (DPCL) into the deep architecture, and develop an end-to-end learning algorithm for optimizing the dictionary pairs and the neural networks simultaneously. Moreover, we design a multi-task loss for guiding our model to accomplish the three correlated tasks: objectness estimation, categoryness computation, and bounding box regression. From the extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 benchmarks, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing object detection frameworks (e.g., R-CNN [13] and FRCN [12]), and achieves new state-of-the-arts.","1063-6919","978-1-4673-8851-1","10.1109/CVPR.2016.235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780604","","Dictionaries;Object detection;Feature extraction;Training;Proposals;Encoding;Neural networks","","30","","39","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present an open-source tool-kit which allows a researcher to investigate different fixed-point representations and saturating arithmetic operations in Python. The tool-kit over-rides arithmetic and comparison functions commonly used in deep learning structures, allowing a researcher to quickly evaluate the impact of alternative numeric representations. Compared to higher-level frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch, a much wider set of numeric precisions can be modeled.

However, the lack of a monitoring system has made it difficult for the technical team to determine the appropriate maintenance procedures. As rotating machinery, CFG machines naturally produce vibrations that are influenced by the alignment and balance of their components. By measuring the intensity of these vibrations, valuable information regarding shaft alignment and balance accuracy can be obtained. To address this issue, industry has implemented a predictive maintenance system for CFG machines that incorporates vibration monitoring. The collected vibration data is utilized to identify any damage occurring in the CFG machines, with each type of damage exhibiting distinct characteristics in the vibration spectrum. The vibration spectrum is analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to facilitate the identification of amplitude and frequency, providing detailed insights into the specific type of damage present in the CFG machines. In addition, this research employs Neural Network (NN) technology to classify the various types of CFG engine damage. Through 18 experiments, the optimal NN architecture was determined to consist of 10 neurons in the hidden layer, with 50 iterations resulting in an MSE value of 0.045. The developed system is capable of accurately classifying the type of CFG engine damage in four conditions: normal, unbalance, misalignment, and looseness, achieving a maximum accuracy rate of 100 percent.","2832-8353","979-8-3503-0922-5","10.1109/ICAMIMIA60881.2023.10427877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10427877","fast fourier transform;maintenance;motor;vibration analysis;neural network","Vibrations;Training;Industries;Neurons;Engines;Biological neural networks;Monitoring","","","","10","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The subsequent challenge is whether more novel device structures using heterogeneous materials and 3D-structures will be invented to realize manufacturable 1-nm ICs. On the other hand, through 20 years of efforts since 1999, many Heterogeneous Integration (HI) [4]–[6] products, each of which is composed of silicon and non-silicon materials/ dice/chiplets, diversified devices/circuits, innovative architectures and multi-dimensional arrangements of dice and other components inside either Chip-package or Module, have been increasingly emerging, especially recently benefiting from a strong driving force stimulated by the IEEE HI Roadmap unveiled in 2018 [5]. This paper presents an exciting, powerful and new Trend of Semiconductors, Intelligent Grand Scale Integration (IGSI), which is optimally utilizing Mixed Integration of Monolithic and HI Technologies (Si-4.0 [6]) with embedded 3A's (Algorithm, Architecture and AI) Design-Intelligences. A key target of IGSI technologies is to drive much higher energy efficiency of managing electronic information for more-effective/ intelligent future systems with better performance, lower power, higher reliability and smaller form-factor than those of our current systems. One effective way as proposed is to network multiple Self-Smart MicroSystems (S-SmS) each of which is designed with 3A's to a complete system level which can handle huge data processing smartly in its own compact multi-dimensional form factor like in a versatile solid-state micro-universe which has abundant self-contained intelligent functions with maximized speed-power efficiency due to close proximity of electronic/photonic/ micro-mechanical operations. It is projected that in such an S-SmS each Joule (energy unit) be able to operate more than 10^20 devices per die per joule allowed by thermodynamics (on the other hand, its performance can reach over hundreds of thousands of TOPS - Tera Operations Per Second) inside and/or across these MicroSystems to complete the final system need. Then how powerful a future system can be by networking enough S-SmS units and furthermore how many unprecedented and unexpected applications will be unleashed! To use AI computing systems as an example, it is expected that S-SmS be quickly applied to AI's edge, device or wearable applications. Moreover, just like the experiences of migrating from a Mainframe computer to networked PC Servers, Data servers used in AI Clouds may use such a networked S-SmS architecture to build large systems in order to optimize the energy efficiency and heat dissipation. The trend equally adds values to system's transformation and optimization in Autonomous Car areas, Industrial 4.0 Factory areas, Telecommunication and Computing areas and so forth.","1523-553X","978-1-6654-0364-1","10.1109/ISSM51728.2020.9377502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377502","Heterogeneous Integration;Smart MicroSystem;Intelligent Grand Scale Integration;HI Roadmap;Silicon Age 4.0","Micromechanical devices;Integrated circuits;Market research;Silicon;Energy efficiency;Servers;Artificial intelligence","","","","19","IEEE","18 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
