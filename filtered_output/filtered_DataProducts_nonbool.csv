10.1145/3649319,The Data Product-service Composition Frontier: A Hybrid Learning Approach,"Quattrocchi, Giovanni; Heuvel, Willem-Jan van den; Tamburri, Damian Andrew",2024,ACM Trans. Manage. Inf. Syst.,"The service dominant logic is a base concept behind modern economies and software products, with service composition being a well-known practice for companies to gain a competitive edge over others by joining differentiated services together, typically assembled according to a number of features. At the other end of the spectrum, product compositions are a marketing device to sell products together in bundles that often augment the value for the customer, e.g., with suggested product interactions, sharing, and so on. Unfortunately, currently each of these two streams—namely, product and service composition—are carried out and delivered individually in splendid isolation: anything is being offered as a product and as a service, disjointly. We argue that the next wave of services computing features more and more service fusion with physical counterparts as well as data around them. Therefore a need emerges to investigate the interactive engagement of both (data) products and services. This manuscript offers a real-life implementation in support of this argument, using (1) genetic algorithms (GA) to shape product-service clusters, (2) end-user feedback to make the GAs interactive with a data-driven fashion, and (3) a hybridized approach which factors into our solution an ensemble machine-learning method considering additional features. All this research was conducted in an industrial environment. With such a cross-fertilized, data-driven, and multi-disciplinary approach, practitioners from both fields may benefit from their mutual state of the art as well as learn new strategies for product, service, and data product-service placement for increased value to the customer as well as the service provider. Results show promise but also highlight plenty of avenues for further research.",10.1145/3649319
10.1145/3687265,Performance Modeling of Distributed Data Processing in Microservice Applications,"Gao, Yicheng; Casale, Giuliano; Singhal, Rekha",2024,ACM Trans. Model. Perform. Eval. Comput. Syst.,"Microservice applications are increasingly adopted in distributed data processing systems, such as in mobile edge computing and data mesh architectures. However, existing performance models of such systems fall short in providing comprehensive insights into the intricate interplay between data placement and data processing. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel class of performance models that enables joint analysis of data storage access workflows, caching, and queueing contention. Our proposed models introduce a notion of access path for data items to model hierarchical data locality constraints. We develop analytical solutions to efficiently approximate the performance metrics of these models under different data caching policies, finding in particular conditions under which the underlying Markov chain admits a product-form solution. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world datasets indicate that service and data placement policies based on our proposed models can respectively improve by up to 35\% and 37\% the average response time in edge and data mesh case studies.",10.1145/3687265
10.1145/3687301,Data Mesh: A Systematic Gray Literature Review,"Goedegebuure, Abel; Kumara, Indika; Driessen, Stefan; Van Den Heuvel, Willem-Jan; Monsieur, Geert; Tamburri, Damian Andrew; Nucci, Dario Di",2024,ACM Comput. Surv.,"Data mesh is an emerging domain-driven decentralized data architecture that aims to minimize or avoid operational bottlenecks associated with centralized, monolithic data architectures in enterprises. The topic has piqued the practitioners’ interest, and considerable gray literature exists. At the same time, we observe a lack of academic attempts at defining and building upon the concept. Hence, in this article, we aim to start from the foundations and characterize the data mesh architecture regarding its design principles, architectural components, capabilities, and organizational roles. We systematically collected, analyzed, and synthesized 114 industrial gray literature articles. The resulting review provides insights into practitioners’ perspectives on the four key principles of data mesh: data as a product, domain ownership of data, self-serve data platform, and federated computational governance. Moreover, due to the comparability of data mesh and SOA (service-oriented architecture), we mapped the findings from the gray literature into the reference architectures from the SOA academic literature to create the reference architectures for describing three key dimensions of data mesh: organization of capabilities and roles, development, and runtime. Finally, we discuss open research issues in data mesh, partially based on the findings from the gray literature.",10.1145/3687301

VLDB Endow.,"We consider the problem of the private release of statistics (like payroll) where it is critical to preserve the contribution made by a small number of outlying large entities. We propose a privacy formalism, per-record zero concentrated differential privacy (PzCDP), where the privacy loss associated with each record is a public function of that record's value. Unlike other formalisms which provide different privacy losses to different records, PzCDP's privacy loss depends explicitly on the confidential data. We define our formalism, derive its properties, and propose mechanisms which satisfy PzCDP that are uniquely suited to publishing skewed or heavy-tailed statistics, where a small number of records contribute substantially to query answers. This targeted relaxation helps overcome the difficulties of applying standard DP to these data products.",10.14778/3681954.3681989
