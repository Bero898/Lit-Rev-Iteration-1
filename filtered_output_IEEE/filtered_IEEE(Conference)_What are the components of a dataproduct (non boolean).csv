However, designing and implementing a self-serve data platform is challenging, and the platform engineers and architects must understand and choose the appropriate design options to ensure the platform will enhance the experience of domain and governance teams. For these reasons, this paper proposes a catalog of architectural design decisions and their corresponding decision options by systematically reviewing 43 industrial gray literature articles on self-serve data platforms in data mesh. Moreover, we used semi-structured interviews with six data engineering experts with data mesh experience to validate, refine, and extend the findings from the literature.

It has obvious advantages in the types of observation instruments, observation band settings, observation time and space resolution, instrument sensitivity, instrument calibration accuracy, and data service capabilities. In order to solve the application interface of FY-4A data and break through the limitations of traditional C/S architecture application software, this paper designs and implements an application platform for service-based FY-4A data automation production and display. Meteorological Information Network Center of Zhejiang Province synchronizes the data of the FY4A satellite provincial receiving station to the provincial data center, and the data transmission aging from the provincial receiving station to the data center is within 2 minutes. The provincial data center uses distributed technology to store FY4A data products and provides sharing access throughout the province, including L1 level data of full disc or China region, and more than 10 kinds of L2 level data such as convective birth and cloud motion wind. The original resolution data is used to develop two versions of the FY-4A application platform for internal and external networks that meet the needs of business services.

However, to reuse this data for new experiments, decision-making processes, and integrate these data with other long-term initiatives, scientists need more information related to data creation and its evolution, intellectual property rights, and technical information in order to evaluate the use of this data. Provenance metadata emerges as a way to evaluate the quality and reliability of data, audit processes and the data versioning, while enabling the data reuse and the reproducibility of experiments and analysis. However, most solutions for the capture and management of provenance metadata are based on specific tools, restricted scopes, and they are difficult to apply in distributed and heterogeneous environments. In this paper, we present an approach for capturing, managing, and publishing the provenance metadata generated in the environmental monitoring processes. Our computational architecture comprises three main components: (1) a data model based in PROV-DM and Dublin Core, (2) a repository of RDF Graphs, and (3) a Web API that provides services for collecting, storing, and querying provenance metadata. We demonstrate the application of our approach and show its practical usefulness by evaluating this architecture to manage provenance metadata generated during an environmental monitoring simulation.

We applied the containerized software paradigm successfully to both the software development and deployment to turn our software architecture in the vehicles following the idea of microservices. Key enabling elements include onboarding of new developers, both researchers and students, traceable development and packaging, convenient and bare-bone deployment, and traceably archiving binary distributions of our quickly evolving software environment. In this paper, we share our experience from working one year with containerized development and deployment for our self-driving vehicles highlighting our reflections and application-specific shortcomings, our approach uses several components from the widely used Docker ecosystem, but the discussion in this paper generalizes these concepts.

The SKA Regional Centres Network (SRCNet) is a collaborative ecosystem tasked with the demanding role of processing and analyzing SKA data products. With SKA, the near-exascale computing will be a challenge, chief among them being the issue of data movement. As computational capabilities, the sheer volume of generated data becomes staggering. The traditional approach of moving tons of data to centralized computing resources becomes impractical due to the limitations of existing networks and storage infrastructures. The data transfer bottleneck becomes a critical impediment, hindering the overall efficiency. To overcome this challenge, a paradigm shift is imperative. Strategies such as in-situ processing and distributed computing models where computation is moved to the data emerge as promising solutions. In the realm of SKA and specifically within SRCNet data processing needs, the conjunction of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) with a decision-making entity driven by Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) becomes pivotal. FaaS abstracts away infrastructure management concerns, enabling the deployment of modular functions in close proximity to data sources. This development aligns with the principle of bringing computation to the data, mitigating the challenges associated with extensive data transfers. The decision-making entity, guided by EAs, facilitates a systematic exploration of near-optimal execution plans, that will provide with detailed information on how and where a function should be executed within the overall computing and data infrastructure. With the focus on two objectives such as execution time and energy consumption, and constraints like data transfers or data locations, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) could be a good option to optimise the movement of the computation to the data. In this context, MOEAs could provide a baseline guide for efficient and cost-effective data processing for the computation model within the SRCNet. Our proposal unifies the technical aspects of FaaS deployment, together with the mathematical modelling and code implementation of a customised first approach MOEA model for the optimisation of function execution plans within the SRCNet architecture and its integration with FaaS.",2473-4691,979-8-3503-6623-5,10.1109/EAIS58494.2024.10570022,Junta de Andalucía; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570022,,Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Decision making;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Data transfer;Data models,,,,15,IEEE,26-Jun-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this concept, the search results are grouped and ranked under facets that guide a user on the dimensions through which the search results can be viewed. It has been implemented on web based query systems by integrating with semantic search engines (like Google, Yahoo and Bing). However, there is a significant opportunity of implementing faceted search in business intelligence (BI) frameworks to include direct searching features through BI dashboards and custom reporting interfaces. In this paper, a technology positioning map for implementing faceted search in BI framework on cloud computing has been presented. BI on the cloud is based on massively parallel processing of hardware and database resources and an XML based service oriented architecture in which the data warehouses and OLAP cubes are formed using XML data files. The architecture has been expanded to include a DOM parser and a DTD mapping system that will parse the 2D XML views (pulled from cubes formed by many-to-many XML files) and extract the database fields to be stored in a facet repository as per pre-established metadata rules. Whenever an OLAP query is invoked by a user (using a decision map), a query coordinator will fetch the relevant 2D OLAP views and group them under facets fetched from the facet repository taking the services of a metadata coordinator. The user can make use of the facets to create direct queries, generate the targeted dashboards, and hence reduce searching time.",,978-0-7695-5046-6,10.1109/GreenCom-iThings-CPSCom.2013.148,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682162,Faceted search;Business intelligence;OLAP;XML;data files;XML DOM parsing;XML data warehouse;OLAP cubes;Cloud computing,XML;Bismuth;Databases;Business;Films;Data warehouses;Search problems,,7,,30,IEEE,12-Dec-13,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, excessive fluctuations in the price would also bring adverse effects to corresponding industry. The price change of agricultural products was the great event vital to national well-being and the people's livelihood. Since the price of agricultural products was affected by many factors, it was difficult to predict the price of agricultural products timely and accurately. The emergence of cloud computing, accompanied by massive storage space, huge computing capacity and low cost, provided a new direction for data mining to deal with big data. To realize the short-term agricultural product price forecasting, took service oriented forecasting as the guidance, this paper constructed a agricultural product price forecasting service system based on the DOA architecture. The system could conduct the analysis and prediction for the market price through the combined forecasting method of wavelet transform and BP neural network. Based on the 72 sets of monthly price data from January 2013 to December 2018 of the spinach, cabbage, tomato, pepper and potato, this paper studied the changing trend of agricultural products price. Firstly, in this paper, the price was conducted the db5 three scale decomposition using wavelet transform. Then, the shredded trend part and detail part were predicted by BP neural network model respectively. Finally, the prediction results of each component were combined and reconstructed. On the basis of this combined forecasting method, the agricultural product price forecasting service system with functions of price data service and price forecasting service was designed based on DOA architecture. To verify the prediction accuracy to the price of the 5 kinds of vegetables, the prediction accuracy index was used to evaluate and analyze the price prediction results of the system. The results showed that the minimum mean absolute error of the system was 0.083 yuan/kg, the minimum mean percentage error was 3.95%, the minimum mean square error was 0.102 and the agricultural product price forecasting service system combining wavelet transform and BP neural network had better agricultural product price forecasting performance. At the same time, this also meant that the universality of this system could adapt to the price forecasting of a variety of vegetables and provide technical support for producers, operators, consumers and relevant government departments.",2159-6190,978-1-7281-8780-8,10.1109/CLOUD49709.2020.00009,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284302,Cloud computing;Wavelet transform;BP neural network;Agricultural products;Price forecasting service,Wavelet transforms;Cloud computing;Analytical models;Neural networks;Predictive models;Agricultural products;Forecasting,,2,,22,IEEE,18-Dec-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

These goals translate into on-board processing throughput requirements that are on the order of 100–1,000x more than those of previous Earth Science missions for standard processing, compression, storage, and downhnk operations. To study possible future architectures to achieve these performance requirements, the SpaceCubeX project provides an evolvable testbed and framework that enables a focused design space exploration of candidate hybrid CPU/FPGA/DSP processing architectures. The framework includes ArchGen, an architecture generator tool populated with candidate architecture components, performance models, and IP cores, that allows an end user to specify the type, number, and connectivity of a hybrid architecture. The framework requires minimal extensions to integrate new processors, such as the anticipated High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC), reducing time to initiate benchmarking by months.

However, OPC technology was based on retiring Microsoft COM/DCOM. The OPC Unified Architecture was introduced as the new generation specification with the main goal of keeping all the functionality of Classic OPC and switching from COM/DCOM technology to state -of-the-art web services. The OPC Foundation has been also developing OPC UA Toolkit that provide a collection of libraries, classes, and interfaces which make developers and programmers easy to create and implement OPC UA components. However, this toolkit is insufficient for developers and programmers to implement real monitoring and control applications from industry due to the limitations of such a toolkit, the complexity of related decision tasks and information systems, etc. In this paper, an OPC UA (Unified Architecture) client framework is proposed and developed by using OPC UA specifications, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), web services, XML, OPC UA SDK, etc. This framework minimizes the efforts of developers and programmers in learning new techniques and allows system arc hitects and designers to perform dependency analysis on the development of monitoring and control applications. The initial results from the system implemented by Visual Studio 2008 are also provided.",,978-1-4577-0399-7,10.1109/IFOST.2011.6021120,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021120,OPC;OPC UA SDK;Client framework;Monitoring and control;Unified Architecture,,,4,,18,IEEE,15-Sep-11,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Technology adoption in the global arena has exponentially increased due to the evolution of smartphones. Due to the above-mentioned factors, E-Commerce has become one of the most widely used transaction methods worldwide to purchase products and services. Traditional Established Businesses can manage E-Commerce without a technology team with the help of EaaS (E-Commerce as a Service) Providers like Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce and Magento which have very high development, subscription and ongoing cloud costs. Small and Medium Scale businesses need a cost-effective, high-performance solution to build the business. To build such a system we have performed research and analysis on available technology paradigms (monolith vs microservices) and Cloud paradigm (IaaS vs PaaS) for finalizing the architecture of the E-Commerce application. In this paper, we showcase the analysis results and elaborate on the implementation of our E-Commerce Application.",,978-1-6654-8407-7,10.1109/CONIT55038.2022.9847829,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847829,AWS;Cloud Computing;eCommerce;Development,Cloud computing;Costs;Ecosystems;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Mobile applications;Electronic commerce,,1,,8,IEEE,18-Aug-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The rational unified process is the most precise and most cited iterative software engineering process that can ensure that alignment, trough comprehensive and simple separate steps, taken within pre - set restrictions [1].Modern software has to be easily managed and easy to scale. By scalable software, we refer to software, where functionality and processing power can be easily attached. For that reason more often than not, the software is divided in smaller components that serve different purposes and are tasked with different responsibilities. Those components can be deployed independently or as as part of greater distributed systems and are easier to collaborate on and to manage. This development framework is referred to as a microservices architecture.Medical applications for treatment, disease prevention and health optimisation can greatly benefit from machine learning and artificial intelligence. The success of such applications is better defined by its ability to include patients and users with different requirements and abilities.In this study we look into the development process of nuhealthsoft, an A.I infused medical application, that uses blood analysis and dieatary variables and other health data for the identification of health states and risk factors, such us metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. The main characteristics of the application will be outlined through the R.U.P methodology. The microservices architecture and the patients’ needs and requirements are the key issues to be addressed in this paper, through the aforementioned methodology and are the forefront, all through the development cycle.",,978-1-6654-6495-6,10.1109/SITIS57111.2022.00065,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090001,Biomarkers;nutritional biomarkers;microservices;rational unified process;user experience;explainable A.I,Microservice architectures;Production;Medical services;Reliability engineering;Software reliability;Stakeholders;Task analysis,,7,,31,IEEE,10-Apr-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
