Infrastructure plays a vital role in application performance, and unreliable infrastructure can hinder application performance, resulting in a poor customer experience. One of the core components that enables application accessibility is the proxy server, which routes incoming traffic to the application that executing business logic. The proxy server runs in the Kubernetes environment in the abstraction of operating system virtualization. As the gateway to applications running in the Kubernetes environment, a gateway server with excellent performance, reliability, and efficient resource utilization is required. The selection of the proxy server as the gateway to the backend application significantly impacts application performance from the userâ€™s perspective. The experiment conducted in this research is to test the backend application accessed through two different proxy servers in the Kubernetes environment. This research compares the response time and hardware resource utilization of the proxy server application, representing common microservice architecture and mesh microservice. This paper proposed the modern microservice architecture and evaluate the performance of common microservice paradigm so enterprise application with high request rate can serve client with lowest latency and efficient resource. The results shows that the Istio ingress proxy is suitable for microservice applications with high request rates while nginx ingress proxy performs better when serving lower request.",2769-5492,979-8-3503-1395-6,10.1109/ISITIA59021.2023.10221035,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10221035,Proxy Server;API Gateway;Cloud Computing;Microservices;Service Mesh,Seminars;Operating systems;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Servers;Resource management,,1,,19,IEEE,23 Aug 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
