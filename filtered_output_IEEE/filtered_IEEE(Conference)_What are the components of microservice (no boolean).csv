However, microservices design is not a trivial task, which highly depends on the profound knowledge and experience of system design and target domain. This is a challenge for novice software architects. In this paper, we propose a microservices design tool named RapidMS, which only requires architects to specify potential context boundaries on the requirements model. The microservices architecture design model with component structure and interaction views can be automatically generated without extra human effort. Moreover, the proposed tool can automatically calculate the characteristic metrics of the microservices, which indicate the quality of the different aspects of models to support rapid architecture refinements. We demonstrate the tool's effectiveness through five case studies. The experimental result shows that architects can get better decomposition of requirement model within four iterations and over 90% of microservice architecture diagrams can be correctly generated within 10 seconds. RapidMS can be further extended and applied in the software industry to reduce the cost and difficulty of microservices decomposition and design.

Software architecture has been proposed as a strategy to decrease complexity and enhance reusability by facilitating system decomposition into its high-level components and their interrelationships. Within the technology sector, the phrase ""e-commerce"" is frequently employed to denote the activities encompassing acquiring, vending, and promoting goods and services. The necessity for an e-commerce enterprise lies in reusable code that pays minimal costs and possesses a streamlined infrastructure. Implementing a suitable architectural framework to meet the existing demands of e-commerce is the most optimal strategy presently.

However, this approach may be subject to certain downsides as well. With the modern convention, engineers have succeeded in achieving scalability and maintainability quality attributes and lack the performance attribute in terms of response time. This is because the microservice architecture has introduced inter-service communication over the network. The key challenge when developing a microservice-based application is choosing the correct inter-service communication mechanism to reduce the time taken when calling each service.

Conversely, Microservices architecture such as Gateway Aggregation and Federated Gateway will divide independent components of the application into smaller modules. Gateway Aggregation utilizes a single Gateway which acts as the main entry point for data exchange between the client and the application. In this research aims an application is developed using the three different architectures to measure the quality, both qualitative and quantitative performances of each architecture. There are several different parameters that are going to be used to measure the architecture’s performance such as response time and data throughput which become an essential criterion in conducting load and stress testing. The result is that the Monolithic architecture offers some advantages in its quantitative performance measurement due to better efficiency in collecting and processing requested data in a single application which utilizes fewer resources and shorter time.

Gathering comprehensive documentation from the legacy system is also essential to establish a solid foundation of requirements and functionalities on which to conduct the migration.

Semi-automated Cross-Component Issue Management and Impact Analysis,S. Speth,"Institute of Software Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany",2021 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),20 Jan 2022,2021,,,1090,1094,"Despite microservices and other component-based architecture styles being state of the art in research for many years by now, issue management across the boundaries of a single component is still challenging. Components that were developed independently and can be used independently are joined together in the overall architecture, which results in dependencies between those components. Due to these dependencies, bugs can result that propagate along the call chains through the architecture. Other types of issues, such as the violation of non-functional quality properties, can also impact other components. However, traditional issue management systems end at the boundaries of a component, making tracking of issues across different components time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, a need for automation arises for cross-component issue management, which automatically puts issues of the independent components in the correct mutual context, creating new cross-component issues and syncing cross-component issues between different components. This automation could enable developers to manage issues across components as efficiently as possible and increases the system’s quality. To solve this problem, we propose an initial approach for semi-automated cross-component issue management in conjunction with service-level objectives based on our Gropius system. For example, relationships between issues of the same or different components can be predicted using classification to identify dependencies of issues across component boundaries. In addition, we are developing a system to model, monitor and alert service-level objectives. Based on this, the impact of such quality violations on the overall system and the business process will be analysed and explained through cross-component issues.",2643-1572,978-1-6654-0337-5,10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678830,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678830,Automated Issue Management;Component-based Architectures;Cross-Component Issues;SLO Monitoring,Automation;Computer bugs;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Software engineering;Business,,5.0,,28.0,IEEE,20 Jan 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It focuses on decomposing system into decoupling autonomous components to support development and deployment independently. This process requires sophisticated human efforts for careful requirements analysis and validation to identify the appropriate microservices boundary inside system modules. Our previous work RM2PT can help to achieve a validated requirements model through automatically generating prototypes from original requirements models. The validated requirements model contains the precise definitions of functionality and data structure that can help in microservices identification. In this paper, we present a tool named RM2MS to further alleviate the problem of cloud-native application development to support automatic identification of microservices from the validated requirements model. RM2MS can automatically analyse the relationship between functionality and data structure, and trade-off non-functional factors for microservices identification. We demonstrate that the microservice architecture solution generated by RM2MS demonstrates a average gain of 27.1% over the manual approach in three key metrics(Function-Cohesion, Modularity, and Instability), while exhibiting efficiency that surpasses the manual process by more than 10-fold through five case studies.

In addition, autonomous driving requires centralized software that generally decreases evolvability with many connections. Thus, the automotive industry adopted the microservice architecture within the service-oriented architecture (SOA), which was already being used in distributed computing environments in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry. However, the software characteristics of an automotive system are different from those of an ICT system. Automotive software generally fulfills safety and real-time requirements that are not required in ICT software. Another challenge is integrating electric control units (ECUs) because software platforms supporting SOA require relatively high computational power and network bandwidth, which increases ECU cost. Thus, the deployment of software functions must be considered before integrating ECUs to find an optimal design solution for evolvability, dependability, real-time performance, cost, etc. However, many OEMs integrate ECUs based on deploying vehicular features without software architecture. It causes optimality problems during integrating ECUs. We propose component-based sensor-process-actuator architectural style for high-level architecture to handle quality attributes. Software architecture for an autonomous electrified vehicle will be presented with the proposed architectural style.

In turn, microservices architecture is an approach for developing applications as a set of small independent services, which may contribute to address such limitations (e.g. maintaining and scaling services independently, according to their specific needs). Indeed, various integration platform proposals leveraging this approach have emerged during the last years.

For example, on an online shopping site, there are several feature sections such as user authorization, shopping cart, payment, shipping, and others, all of these features are built in an integrated manner on the same codebase. This is different from the microservice architecture approach. In microservices, each feature or component will be an architecture that is separate from one another. Each of these services will later communicate with each other via a special protocol. Mololithic is increasingly being abandoned because it does not meet scalability needs, if there is a surge in users the Mololithic model tends to be unstable.As happens in the SSO module, in the SSO module process itself there are several functions including registration, authentication, user management, back end API and several other functions where these functions are combined in one unified module. Therefore, a Microservices Architecture model is needed to handle the needs due to the surge in users. Scalability can be regulated because the codebase separation process depends on needs. The migration process from monolithic to microservices is not easy, it requires sufficient knowledge regarding the application to determine the number of nodes and determine the number of services. This research will separate the codebase to determine the number of services using extraction design patterns on function entities, and system logs used in the SSO module at one institution in Indonesia.It is hoped that by extracting functions from the source code and data transaction we will get how many services are running and the nodes that will be used.

Microservices are distinguished by their compact size, cohesive functionality, and independent operation, positioning them as a formidable alternative to traditional architectures. However, identifying optimal microservice configurations poses significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative automated method for deriving microservices from business processes, incorporating a broader BPMN with more activities and dependencies than previous studies to verify the quality of our approach. Our method leverages a cooperative clustering strategy that integrates multiple models to analyze control, information, and semantic connections within business operations. Each dependency type is addressed by a dedicated clustering algorithm, allowing modules to leverage insights from one another, thereby enhancing microservice identification accuracy. We validate our methodology through a case study in a bike rental service, involving 25 distinct activities to evaluate our dependency model’s effectiveness.

However, these systems adopt the static properties from their domain, which have led to their success and widespread use in Industry 4.0. The most critical core difficulties with OPC UA are the definition of communication mechanisms and the data model to be used in a strictly coupled environment. Because of their central client-server architecture and missing communication patterns, these systems do not offer the necessary flexibility and platform independence to use the entire spectrum of possible software tools efficiently.

However, in most real-world cases, the adoption of microservices is not a deliberate choice made by organizations. Instead, the shift towards microservices is compelled by the urgent necessity to overcome the constraints imposed by traditional monolithic architectures. As a result, organizations typically seek to migrate their existing systems to microservices incrementally and with caution to ensure safe migration. To achieve this particular goal, the industry has provided various strategies and patterns. However, many practitioners overlook a very important aspect while migrating to microservices, which is the presence of anti-patterns and their potential evolution during the migration phases. Therefore, studies and investigations are needed to assist the migration task to microservices against anti-patterns.

Microservices architecture is preferable since it promotes independence of software modification, maintenance, and deployment. However, anti-patterns or poor development patterns of microservices can decrease the software quality. Nonetheless, quality measurement of microservices design based on anti-patterns has not been found in existing research. Using the QMOOD method for quality model design, this paper proposes a microservices quality model based on 11 microservices anti-patterns and ISO/IEe 25010 as a standard reference for quality attributes.

Fire cases that often occur require a system that is able to detect fires and provide information to users remotely to reduce the impact of fires. Along with the development of hardware technology such as computers, the use of GIS seems to be an effective shortcut in analyzing an event. Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized application workloads, offering declarative configuration and automation. This research designs a Google Maps API System tool for forest and land fires using a real-time database on microservices infrastructure with outputs in the form of fire locations and the results of sensor readings used. Broadly speaking, the processes that occur in the design of the location of forest fire points will be detected by sensors. Then firebase will store forest fire data which will simultaneously be updated on the website. Clients can see the point of forest fires through a browser on their respective desktops. Based on the results of the performance tests that have been carried out, it can be concluded that the use of Kubernetes microclusters can provide advantages when compared to those built monolithically, because Kubernetes microclusters have several advantages, namely having the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler feature, and the Kubernetes microcluster manages components and related services well. Then for each test performed, there was no significant change in memory usage. In the analysis of the results of the comparison data with 7 tests that have been carried out there are 6 tests which mean that the service built with the Kubernetes microcluster is superior to the monolithic one, namely hits per second 2354 ms, latency 3599 ms, response code 720 success code, cpu utilization 13.84%, error rate error rate 0.00%, and throughput 112/sec.",2832-1383,979-8-3503-9645-4,10.1109/IoTaIS56727.2022.9975953,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9975953,SIG;Detector;Fire;Kubernetes;Microservices,Codes;Error analysis;Databases;Microservice architectures;Forestry;Throughput;Real-time systems,,1.0,,23.0,IEEE,13 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As a more flexible architecture, microservices consist of smaller pieces or services that are loosely coupled and can be deployed independently. More and more IT companies are adopting microservices architecture. However, migrating to microservices is still a big challenge due to the lack of a more systematic methodology on microservices identification. Most existing studies on microservices identification are mainly based on refactoring the system module rather than considering the actual functional requirements. Therefore, we propose a microservices identification approach based on the problem frames to address this challenge, which considers real-world requirements. It relies on the merging process with the problem diagram, where the problem domain is processed, and the causal chain is obtained by searching the problem diagram. Subsequently, we calculate the correlation degree of the domains in the problem diagram. Then, based on the calculated correlation, we implement a clustering algorithm for the problem domains and get the categorization result of the problem domains which is the initial microservice candidate. The developers can consider each category of the problem domain as a microservice by converting the problem domains into the microservices. Finally, a case study verifies the validity of our proposed approach.",,978-1-6654-8223-3,10.1109/SEAI55746.2022.9832106,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832106,Microservices;microservices migration;problem frames;problem domain,Correlation;Systematics;Conferences;Merging;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Companies,,1.0,,12.0,IEEE,25 Jul 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this paper, we consider the scenario with multiple video analytics applications from a single video stream. However, traditional monolithic architecture based video analytics applications shall seriously increase the response latency due to the resource contention of repetitive components. Therefore, we utilize the microservice architecture based video analytics (MAVA) to share the universal microser-vices in different applications, which shall decrease the response latency by reducing the computation load and increasing the resource utilization. To further achieve fast and accurate video analytics, the video analytics microservices are deployed in the edge closing to the cameras and users, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used in the microservices to realize specified functions. Therefore, an edge AI enabled MAVA (EAI-MAVA) architecture is proposed to achieve accurate video analytics in real-time. Furthermore, we formulate a microservice deployment problem to determine the location of each microservice in EAI-MAVA, which minimizes the response latency of all applications by considering the resource demands of microservices and the resource constraints of heterogeneous edge devices.

In parallel, Agents are fully intelligent, atomic, and autonomous decision-making units that can be flexibly recomposed to create a completely autonomous network system. They also have the ability to replicate single or multiple decision-making processes that collaborate with each other.

There are many reasons for this - primary being that the kind of skills needed to understand the business need, understand the data, develop models, develop applications, and integrate models with applications are different and it is very difficult for one person or just a group of application developers or just a group of data scientists to have all these skills. This makes it challenging to productionalize the developed ML models fast or at all in order to experiment with them further. This paper demonstrates how certain components of the Acumos AI platform project can be used to take models developed using H2o, Java, Spark to production by deploying them as microservices, automatically. The same concept can be (and has been extended by Acumos) to Python, R and ONNX models. What this enables is - multiple heterogeneous models written by different developers or different teams or different organizations in different languages and frameworks becoming functioning microservices that would provide intelligent APIs to the business application in question. These models can then be easily shared with different individuals and organizations and operationalized easily. Using Acumos, these microservices can be deployed such that they also communicate and co-ordinate with each other to do much more complex tasks.

The emergence of Cloud Computing has evolved towards microservice concepts, which are highly demanded by corporates for enterprise application level. Most enterprise applications have moved away from traditional unified models of software programs like monolithic architecture and traditional SOA architecture to microservice architecture to ensure better scalability, lesser investment in hardware, and high performance. The monolithic architecture is designed in a manner that all the components and the modules are packed together and deployed on a single binary. However, in the microservice architecture, components are developed as small services so that horizontally and vertically scaling is made easier in comparison to monolith or SOA architecture. SOA and monolithic architecture are at a disadvantage compared to Microservice architecture, as they require colossal hardware specifications to scale the software. In general terms, the system performance of these architectures can be measured considering different aspects such as system capacity, throughput, and latency. This research focuses on how scalability and performance software quality attributes behave when converting the SOA system to microservice architecture.

If we make a more detailed analysis of them, they are nothing more than standalone applications that are synchronized in their communication between them, they are interchangeable in certain situations, and they are also divided by functionality. In addition to microservices, the so-called monolithic applications also work with the reception and processing of requests, which architecturally translates into an even greater concentration of functionality in one place and this leads to difficulties in their maintenance. In modern microservice architectures, different methods of communication are often used: microservices often communicate via HTTP with RESTful API design. URLs are used to detect and access microservices. Message Brokers: the use of communications brokers such as RabbitMQ 1 or Apache Kafka 2 provides an effective way of asynchronous communication. Whether we are talking about monolithic or microservice applications, it always comes the moment with the growing code, complex service structure and maintenance. In the current development, we focus on the implementation of a new service in a microservice architecture. The goal of the development is to create an application architecture using design patterns and optimization solutions that lead to fast and efficient operations of the business layer, which remains stable in its performance even with a large amount of data to process.1www.rabbitmq.com2https://kafka.apache.org",,979-8-3503-7115-4,10.1109/ECAI61503.2024.10607395,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10607395,Web API;Command pattern;Microservice,Codes;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Software;Maintenance;Safety;Logic,,,,14.0,IEEE,30 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
A Case For Cross-Domain Observability to Debug Performance Issues in Microservices,R. K; P. Tammana; P. G. Kannan; P. Naik,"IIT Hyderabad, India; IIT Hyderabad, India; IBM Research, India; IBM Research, India",2022 IEEE 15th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD),24 Aug 2022,2022,,,244,246,"Many applications deployed in the cloud are usually refactored into small components called microservices that are deployed as containers in a Kubernetes environment. Such applications are deployed on a cluster of physical servers which are connected via the datacenter network.In such deployments, resources such as compute, memory, and network, are shared and hence some microservices (culprits) can misbehave and consume more resources. This interference among applications hosted on the same node leads to performance issues (e.g., high latency, packet loss) in the microservices (victims) followed by a delayed or low-quality response. Given the highly distributed and transient nature of the workloads, it’s extremely challenging to debug performance issues. Especially, given the nature of existing monitoring tools, which collect traces and analyze them at individual points (network, host, etc) in a disaggregated manner.In this paper, we argue toward a case for a cross-domain (network & host) monitoring and debugging framework which could provide the end-to-end observability to debug performance issues of applications and pin-point the root-cause whether it is on the sender-host, receiver-host or the network.

The application transaction in legacy applications is based on a traditional unified architecture on which a single application and database structure under low latency is assumed, which means that a significant decrease in performance can occur on microservice-oriented architectures composed of distributed application and database structures under high latency. Therefore, transaction refactoring is essential for application modernization. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to manually identify the transaction split point in an application transaction. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically refactoring the recommendation for application transactions by identifying the split point on the basis of database operation and business contexts. Our approach involves using a framework we designed for discovering application transactions from binary Java code and two partitioning methods, “operation-based splitting“ and “business-context-based splitting“ for detecting the optimal split points for application transactions in applications with different implementation patterns. We applied our approach to actual enterprise applications, identified split points for transaction-refactoring recommendation, and showed that it can significantly reduce processing time compared with doing it manually.",,979-8-3503-4075-4,10.1109/SSE60056.2023.00035,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10234330,Microservice-oriented architecture;Service-oriented system engineering;Service discovery;Service recommendation,Java;Codes;Microservice architectures;Distributed databases;Computer architecture;Software;Low latency communication,,2.0,,17.0,IEEE,4 Sep 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

They represent the latest evolutionary step in the decades-old journey towards service-and component-based software architectures. Along with virtualization technologies, microservices have enabled the loose-coupling of both service interfaces (message passing) and service integration (form and fit). This paper attempts to explore the impact of microservices on software architecture interoperability and repeatability, based on our experiences in developing two microservice-based systems. Our central thesis is that, if we view software architecture as a set of principal design decisions, the microservices approach enable us to more elegantly separate these decisions from non-architectural, domain-specific ones, and thus make these decisions more interoperable, reusable, and repeatable across disparate problem domains.

MAAD: A Distributed Anomaly Detection Architecture for Microservices Systems,R. Tan; Z.

However, existing anomaly detection systems often necessitate the centralization of log and trace data from diverse system components and rely on resource-intensive statistical methods or deep learning models for analysis. This approach impedes real-time anomaly detection and requires a significant demand on computing resources. In this paper, we design a multi-agent-based, distributed anomaly detection architecture called MAAD to address the limitations. MAAD consists of a collection of agents that cooperate together to identify abnormal behaviors in a distributed manner. Each agent is deployed along with a single service and applies lightweight machine learning techniques to perform local anomaly detection based on its own logs, local context, and information extracted from its parent span service.To preserve the graph information in a microservices request, an agent can communicate essential features with each other, taking into account the collective patterns learned from the prior services. We evaluate the effectiveness of MAAD on two microservices datasets, TrainTicket and MicroSS, and show that MAAD achieved high precision (up to 95.8%) and recall (up to 99.6%), outperforming state-of-the-art centralized anomaly detection approaches. Compared to centralized approaches, MAAD reduces the amount of transferred data before anomaly detection by approximately 88%, facilitating real-time anomaly detection. Furthermore, the lightweight nature of MAAD allows for rapid anomaly detection with minimal impact on microservices systems. Compared to DeepLog, MAAD saves approximately 92% detection time without using GPU accelerators.",1530-2075,979-8-3503-8711-7,10.1109/IPDPS57955.2024.00094,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Southern University of Science and Technology; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10579128,Microservices system;anomaly detection;multi-agent,Deep learning;Distributed processing;Statistical analysis;Microservice architectures;Graphics processing units;Computer architecture;Feature extraction,,,,55.0,IEEE,8 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Firstly, to mitigate the interference from anomaly propagation, TraceNet builds the microservice dependency graph by distinguishing different operations, which depicts the complex microservice dependency at the operation dimension. Then, TraceNet classifies abnormality into inner-abnormality and outer-abnormality, and quantifies the abnormality of microservices by an edge-operation-microservice aggregation, Finally, TraceNet locates root causes based on the largest anomaly subgraph and candidates' different impacts, without human interference.

This architecture splits a monolithic application into multiple independent components and the container orchestrator manages these components by the container in the cloud environment. The feasibility of deploying high performance computing(HPC) applications as microservices has been proven, but the existing container orchestrator incurs a large performance overhead as there is interference between different containers on the same physical host. In this paper, we design an agile workflow microservice system for HPC applications with fast-start OSv. We consider improving HPC workflow performance from two aspects: single OSv startup time optimization and workflow orchestration optimization. For single OSv startup time optimization, we design a fast-start OSv by analyzing the process of OSv startup and finding an optimization by modifying OSv source code. In this way, we get nearly 50% improvement of startup time. For workflow orchestration optimization, we propose four optimization techniques to speed up the execution of workflow by jointly considering OSv and workflow features, namely: node fusion, node merge, image preload, boot delay. Furthermore, we utilize our fast startup OSv to design an orchestration system for efficiently building an agile HPC workflow microservice by Kubevirt.

BLOC: Balancing Load with Overload Control In the Microservices Architecture,R. Bhattacharya; T. Wood,"Department of Computer Science, George Washington University; Department of Computer Science, George Washington University",2022 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Self-Organizing Systems (ACSOS),4 Nov 2022,2022,,,91,100,"The microservices architecture has become ubiquitous in the cloud environment. It simplifies application development by breaking monolithic applications into manageable micro services that can be developed and deployed independently of the whole. However, the move from a monolithic or simple multi-tier architecture to a distributed microservice ""service mesh"" leads to new challenges due to the more complex application topology.A particular problem when automatically managing the performance of microservices is that since each service component scales up and down independently, it can easily create load imbalance problems on shared backend services accessed by multiple components. Traditional load balancing algorithms were designed for centralized load balancers sitting between a group of clients and a server farm. These algorithms, however, do not port over well to a distributed microservice architecture where load balancers are deployed client-side. In this paper we propose a self managing load balancing system, BLOC, which provides consistent response times to users without using a centralized metadata store or explicit messaging between nodes.We show that different service layers scaling independently can create unacceptably wide response time distributions and long tails, hurting client experience. This is because popular microservice load balancing algorithms, like Least Connection, only use a single component’s view of the backend load to guide decisions. This limited perspective leads to an unevenly balanced system and the potential for incast problems where a large number of frontend components can easily overload a shared backend. BLOC uses overload control approaches like rate limiting, active queue management and backpressure to provide feedback to the load balancers. The load balancers react to this feedback with techniques like backoff and retries. We show that this performs significantly better in solving the incast problem in microservice architectures.Evaluating this framework, we found that BLOC improves the response time distribution range, between the 10th and 90th percentiles, by 2 to 4 times and the tail, 99th percentile, latency by two times.",,978-1-6654-7137-4,10.1109/ACSOS55765.2022.00027,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9935022,microservices;loadbalancing;overload control,Limiting;Microservice architectures;Tail;Metadata;Load management;Control systems;User experience,,4.0,,21.0,IEEE,4 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Case for Microservices Orchestration Using Workflow Engines,A. Nadeem; M. Z. Malik,"North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, USA; North Dakota State University, Fargo, North Dakota, USA",2022 IEEE/ACM 44th International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Results (ICSE-NIER),13 Jun 2022,2022,,,6,10,"Microservices have become the de-facto software architecture for cloud-native applications. A contentious architectural decision in microservices is to compose them using choreography or orchestration. In choreography, every service works independently, whereas, in orchestration, there is a controller that coordinates service interactions. This paper makes a case for orchestration. The promise of microservices is that each microservice can be independently developed, deployed, tested, upgraded, and scaled. This makes them suitable for systems running on cloud infrastructures. However, microservice-based systems become complicated due to the complex interactions of various services, concurrent events, failing components, developers’ lack of global view, and configurations of the environment. This makes maintaining and debugging such systems very challenging. We hypothesize that orchestrated services are easier to debug and to test this we ported the largest publicly available microservices’ benchmark TrainTicket [24], which is implemented using choreography, to a fault-oblivious stateful workflow framework Temporal [19]. We report our experience in porting the code from traditional choreographed microservice architecture to one orchestrated by Temporal and present our initial findings of time to debug the 22 bugs present in the benchmark. Our findings suggest that an effort towards making a transition to orchestrated approach is worthwhile, making the ported code easier to debug.",,978-1-6654-9596-7,10.1145/3510455.3512777,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793520,Microservices;Distributed Systems;Orchestration;Workflow Engines;Fault tolerance;Debugging,Visualization;Codes;Software architecture;Computer bugs;Microservice architectures;Debugging;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Engines,,,,25.0,IEEE,13 Jun 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Applications have evolved from large monoliths to complex graphs of loosely-coupled microservices aiming to improve deployment flexibility and operational efficiency. However, modern microservice-based architectures are challenging since proper allocation and scaling of microservices is a difficult task due to their complex inter-dependencies. Existing works do not consider microservice dependencies, which could lead to the application’s performance degradation when service demand increases. This paper studies the impact of microservice interdependencies in auto-scaling mechanisms by proposing a novel framework named gym-hpa that enables different auto-scaling goals via Reinforcement Learning (RL). The framework has been developed based on the OpenAI Gym library for the popular Kubernetes (K8s) platform to bridge the gap between RL and auto-scaling research by training RL agents on real cloud environments. The aim is to improve resource usage and reduce the application’s response time in future cloud platforms by considering microservice inter-dependencies in horizontal scaling. Experiments with microservice benchmark applications show that RL agents trained with the gym-hpa framework can reduce on average resource usage by 30% and reduce the application’s response time by 25% compared to default scaling mechanisms.",2374-9709,978-1-6654-7716-1,10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154298,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154298,Auto-scaling;Containers;Cloud-native;Microservices;Orchestration;Reinforcement Learning;Kubernetes,Training;Degradation;Microservice architectures;Reinforcement learning;Containers;Benchmark testing;Libraries,,10.0,,48.0,IEEE,21 Jun 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

These features are enabled using a pre-defined configuration, which can be changed at runtime with human intervention. However, it has no autonomy to self-manage changes to the microservice application’s operational environment. A better configuration is one that can be customized according to environmental conditions during execution to protect the application from potential threats. This customization requires enabling self-protection mechanisms within the service mesh that evaluate the risk of environmental condition changes and enable appropriate configurations to defend the application from impending threats. In this paper, we design an assessment component into a service mesh that includes a security assurance case to define the threat model and dynamically assess the application given environment changes. We experiment with a demo application, Bookinfo, using an open-source service mesh platform, Istio, to enable self-protection. We consider certain parameters extracted from the service request as environmental conditions. We evaluate those parameters against the threat model and determine the risk of violating a security requirement for controlled and authorized information flow.",,978-1-6654-5142-0,10.1109/ACSOSC56246.2022.00047,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9934881,microservices;service mesh;self-protection;assessment;threat model,Runtime;Computational modeling;Microservice architectures;Computer architecture;Security;Observability;Distributed computing,,,,32.0,IEEE,4 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To better profile the microservice, we propose a framework that provides nonintrusive measurements on microservice inference, or MEME, to detect fraudulent behaviors of cloud service providers on microservice-based applications.

We model the microservice-based application with a set of cohorts and use FFT to obtain the signal formed by the main frequency components of average response time. Our model represents the performance portrait of the microservice-based application. The performance portrait is similar to a fingerprint that carries internal software information.

An UAV has shown promising results in dangerous conditions such as forest fires, search and rescue, medical deliveries, wildlife monitoring and geophysical scanning. Some external conditions like slow or no internet connection areas such as rural, farm, forest, ocean, etc. may affect the performance of the UAVs. These conditions can be considered as lost-link problems. Several approaches have been conducted to resolve such issues by implementing robust on-board architecture, machine learning approaches and developing knowledge based reasoning systems. However, much of software architecture research has concentrated on UAV implementation in normal network condition. Thus, we propose a model for considering lost-link problems in software architecture. In this paper, we describe two interconnected architectures for client and server. The UAV as a client is controlled by microkernel based architecture and the server is developed using microservice architecture. Both of them are connected using a synchronizer component to collect, filter, analyze, predict, and mitigate an UAV when a lost-link problem occurs.

Monolithic legacy applications in industry undergo a migration to microservice-oriented architectures. A key challenge in this context is the extraction of microservices from existing monolithic code bases. While informal migration patterns and techniques exist, there is a lack of formal models and automated support tools in that area. This paper tackles that challenge by presenting a formal microservice extraction model to allow algorithmic recommendation of microservice candidates in a refactoring and migration scenario. The formal model is implemented in a web-based prototype. A performance evaluation demonstrates that the presented approach provides adequate performance. The recommendation quality is evaluated quantitatively by custom microservice-specific metrics. The results show that the produced microservice candidates lower the average development team size down to half of the original size or lower. Furthermore, the size of recommended microservice conforms with microservice sizing reported by empirical surveys and the domain-specific redundancy among different microservices is kept at a low rate.",,978-1-5386-0752-7,10.1109/ICWS.2017.61,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029803,microservices;extraction;coupling;graph-based clustering,Couplings;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Industries;Tools,,147.0,3.0,21.0,IEEE,11 Sep 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

To address these challenges, many companies are embracing the microservices architectural style as a more flexible alternative to their monoliths. Microservices structure systems into modular, independent components, enabling easier development, deployment, and maintenance. However, the migration from a monolith to microservices is challenging due to the laborious task of manually identifying and decomposing a system into microservices. Several earlier studies focused on developing approaches to facilitate the migration process. However, the reliance on domain experts to define various parameters and thresholds restricted their use. In this paper, we introduce Magnet, a fully automated microservice identification approach, based on graph neural networks (GNNs). Magnet integrates a GNN model with a fine-grained method-based graph enriched with semantic and static features of the system. It enables accurate microservices identification while simultaneously promoting microservice cohesion and reducing microservice coupling. To validate the accuracy of Magnet, we performed extensive experiments using a set of open-source systems. Quantitatively, we use a set of quality metrics to assess the resulting microservices quality. We also compare our results to established ground truths. Empirical evidence suggests that our fully-automated approach Magnet achieves precision and recall rates of 56% and 68%.

LEAD considers the inter-service relationships and resource constraints, improving service placement to reduce end-to-end latency. The idea behind LEAD is straightforward: keep the cooperating services close to each other to exploit faster in-node communication and automate this process. The proposed idea is realized by leveraging a scoring algorithm and monitoring framework to achieve dynamic improvement of service placement.

Existing work focuses on identifying the best VM types for recurrent (mostly high-performance computing) jobs.

Nonetheless, when confronted with the necessity to scale, the system encounters monitoring challenges, as it must contend with an increased volume of requests while simultaneously accommodating fluctuating demands across various geographic regions. Aside from that, detecting errors in such a model becomes increasingly difficult, because of the many abstraction layers and interconnected microservices a cloud solution has. In that context, metrics can be used to identify errors and monitor the system's state. The substantial diversity in the types of services and the metrics themselves introduces a formidable complexity to the analysis of an entire cluster. Therefore, it is important to identify the essential metrics in microservices that can be used to recognize issues or bottlenecks. In pursuit of this objective, a cloud-based solution was implemented within an Amazon Web Services Kubernetes cluster to emulate the functionality of an online retail store and an automated testing framework was made to inject errors in different parts of this application while its metrics were obtained. In that way, it was possible to identify the effects that errors have on the metrics of components in the system, rendering the monitoring of the cluster a more direct process and reducing the amount of data to be analyzed in order to identify the presence of errors in a cloud environment.",,979-8-3503-8160-3,10.1109/SBAC-PADW60351.2023.00028,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10305981,Cloud computing;Chaos engineering;Microservice;Observability,Measurement;Cloud computing;Web services;Scalability;High performance computing;Microservice architectures;Rendering (computer graphics),,1.0,,11.0,IEEE,8 Nov 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The microservice architectural style requires the architects to refine a macro-level security policy into micro-level policies for individual microservices. However, when policies are refined in an ill-formed way, information leaks can emerge on composition of microservices. Related approaches to prevent such leaks do not take into account characteristics of cyber-physical systems like real-time behavior or message passing communication. In this paper, we enable the refinement and verification of information-flow security policies for cyber-physical microservice architectures. We provide architects with a set of well-formedness rules for refining a macro-level policy in a way that enforces its security restrictions.

In a MSA, the application is built as a composite of microservices (also called services) where each service is dedicated to providing specific functionalities and communicating via APIs. The service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer serving as a service-to-service communication platform. It is introduced to alleviate the complexity, manageability, and interoperability challenges involved in a MSA. Even though the service mesh includes APIs to secure service-to-service communication, more functionality is needed to handle the perimeter-less and dynamic cloud environment. The existing APIs enable security measures based on a pre-defined configuration. However, there is no mechanism for dynamic trust evaluation of the participating services, which is necessary to protect the application from potential attacks. Attackers can exploit a vulnerability caused by a rouge service as a backdoor to compromise the application. Thus, there is a need for a trust evaluation mechanism in the service mesh to follow zero-trust architecture (ZTA) principles. This paper introduces a runtime trust evaluator (RTE) incorporated as a component within the service mesh control plane. A RTE can evaluate the trustworthiness of services at runtime before establishing service-to-service communications. The core functionality of a RTE is to assess the new service invocation requests initiated by a service to evaluate the trustworthiness of that service. The RTE collects the services’ invocation history and other telemetric data to determine the services’ criticality level for single-point failure. The RTE assesses service invocation request attributes to determine the existence of an unauthorized request and the impact on the requested service’s criticality level. The result is an evaluation of the initiator service’s trustworthiness. We demonstrate our approach on an open source microservice application from the Google Cloud team called Online Boutique.

Using this approach, large software systems are implemented by combining loosely-coupled services, each responsible for specific task and defined with separate scaling properties. Auto-scaling is a primary capability of cloud computing which allows systems to adapt to fluctuating traffic loads by dynamically increasing (scale-up) and decreasing (scale-down) the number of resources used.We observe that when microservices which utilize separate auto-scaling mechanisms operate in tandem to process traffic, they may perform ineffectively, especially under overload conditions, due to DDoS attacks. This can result in throttling (Denial of service - DoS) and over-provisioning of resources (Economic Denial of Sustainability - EDoS).This paper demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the tandem behavior of microservices with different auto-scaling mechanisms to create an attack we denote as the Tandem Attack.

The increasing adoption of microservice architectures, while offering scalability and flexibility, poses new challenges in the effective management of systems’ energy consumption.This study analyzes experimentally the effectiveness, with respect to energy consumption, of algorithms for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for (containerized) microservices systems. The study analyzes five AD and three RCA algorithms. Metrics to assess the effectiveness of AD algorithms are Precision, Recall, and F-Score. For RCA algorithms, the chose metric is Precision at level k. Two subjects of different complexity are used: Sock Shop and UNI-Cloud. Experiments use a cross-over paired comparison design, involving multiple randomized runs for robust measures.The experiments show that AD algorithms exhibit a relatively moderate performance. The mean adjusted Precision for Sock Shop is 61.5%, while it is 75% for the best-performing algorithms (BIRCH, KNN, and SVM) on UNI-Cloud. The Recall and F-Score for UNI-Cloud, for the same algorithms, are 75%, while for Sock Shop KNN yields the best outcome at roughly 45%. MicroRCA and RCD emerge as the top-performing algorithms for RCA.We found that the effectiveness of AD algorithms is strongly influenced by anomaly thresholds, emphasizing the importance of careful tuning such algorithms. RCA algorithms reveal promising results, particularly RCD and MicroRCA, which showed robust performance. However, challenges remain, as seen with the ϵ-diagnosis algorithm, suggesting the need for further refinement.For DevOps engineers, the findings highlight the need to carefully select and tune AD and RCA algorithms for energy, and to take into account system topology and monitoring configurations.",2836-3868,979-8-3503-6855-0,10.1109/ICWS62655.2024.00079,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707452,Microservices;Energy consumption;Anomaly Detection;Root Cause Analysis,Measurement;Energy consumption;Root cause analysis;Web services;Software algorithms;Microservice architectures;Nearest neighbor methods;Topology;Anomaly detection;Tuning,,,,39.0,IEEE,15 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The companies using it have diverse requirements on both functionality and quality attributes and would thus benefit from more versatile customizations, e.g. regarding authorization and data replication. Objective: ICAB needed help in assessing the current architecture of EMG in order to find candidates for architectural changes as well as fulfilling the needs of variability in meeting the wide range of customer requirements. Method: We analysed EMG using a lightweight version of ATAM (Architectural Trade-off Analysis Method) to get a better understanding of how different architectural decisions would affect the trade-offs between the quality requirements from the identified stakeholders. Result: Using the results of this structured approach, it was easy for ICAB to identify the functionality that needed to be improved. It also became clear that the selected component should be converted into a set of microservices, each one optimized for a specific set of customers. Limitation: The stakeholder requirements were gathered intermittently during a long period of continuous engagement, but there is a chance some of their requirements were still not communicated to us. Conclusion: Even though this ATAM study was performed internally at ICAB without direct involvement from any external stakeholders, documenting elicited quality attribute requirements and relating them to the EMG architecture provided new, unexpected, and valuable understandings of the system with a rather small effort.",,978-1-7281-7415-0,10.1109/ICSA-C50368.2020.00013,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095659,Architecture;Monolith;ATAM;Microservice,Electromyography;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Stakeholders;Companies;Software,,1.0,,22.0,IEEE,19 May 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This complexity calls for a new, scalable architecture to allow the systems to operate efficiently.

Design and implementation of a decentralized message bus for microservices,P. Kookarinrat; Y. Temtanapat,"Computer Science Department, Thammasat University; Computer Science Department, Thammasat University",2016 13th International Joint Conference on Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE),21 Nov 2016,2016,,,1,6,"A new software architecture, known as microservices, becomes rapidly popular recently. Microservices could help developers cope well with the problems of software complexity and demands on an adaptive development process that needs to respond to changes quickly. In this architecture, a single monolithic large application would be divided into small multiple isolated services. They are separately deployed and communicated to other services via remote calls. This architectural style allows any changes on one service not affecting the others. However, if services directly make remote calls, it would create interdependencies and tight couplings between them. To remove such problem, this paper proposes a decentralized message bus to use as a communication tool between services. Our message bus provides a framework for services to collaborate. It divides into four main components, public API, message bus, messaging and service discovery. The API uses the HTTP and RESTful style of communication. We use decentralized service discovery to avoid a single point of failure of the system. The messaging uses a simple TCP connection with only a header and body in its message. We also define three necessary communication messages for the services, viz. request/response, notification and publish/subscribe. The proposed framework is implemented and tested with a real-world scenario. It works correctly without any problem. Also, to realize how it could be scaled, we run the system continuously with incremental services and traffics. From the observation on the resource consumption of CPU, memory and network I/O, we found that the network consumption grows linearly while the CPU and memory usages have little change in consumption.",,978-1-5090-2033-1,10.1109/JCSSE.2016.7748869,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7748869,microservices;message bus;software architecture,Protocols;Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Scalability;Iris;Computer science;Load modeling,,4.0,,14.0,IEEE,21 Nov 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The service mesh employs features for continuous monitoring and ensuring delivery of service requests among services securely and reliably. The service mesh should enable threat intelligence sharing among the services at runtime as a part of continuous monitoring so that services are aware of potential threats and adapt to mitigate the threats. Threat intelligence contains detailed descriptions of attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) that are analyzed for countermeasure deployment. In this paper, we introduce threat intelligence sharing (TIS) into the control plane of the service mesh to enable the sharing of threat intelligence among services in an automated manner. It requires a structured format to specify threat intelligence and a well-defined protocol for sharing intelligence. We adopt a structured threat information expression (STIX) schema to specify threat intelligence and use the trusted automated exchange of intelligence information (TAXII) as a defined protocol to share threat intelligence as STIX documents. The advantage of including a TIS component in the service mesh is that it can generate threat intelligence using available telemetry data and enable sharing among the services without forcing services to modify their functionalities to support the process.

Moving Toward the Obsolescence of Obsolescence: A Walk in the Clouds,R. Griffin; N. Henson,"Field Applications NI, Phoenix, Arizona; Professional Services NI, Denver, Colorado",2022 IEEE AUTOTESTCON,23 Dec 2022,2022,,,1,8,"Many software methodologies advanced by cloud computing can be applied to automatic test software to mitigate test system obsolescence challenges. Classical monolithic test, measurement, and automation systems have traditional challenges when test system components become out-of-date. Distributed computing technologies provide incremental and modular updates that can be applied proactively or reactively to handle equipment failures, shifts in hardware (HW) and software (SW) dependencies, and improved HW and SW components. Advances in cloud computing have driven software technologies that can unlock scaling across hardware systems, introduce service architectures, open new performance possibilities, and decouple historically interlocked components. This paper will address aerospace and defense software challenges, introduce cloud computing, both service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud-native microservices, explain underlying principles and tenets, and craft a practical path forward. The cloud will be brought down to earth by showing how some underlying principles and tenets can be used today. These include the single responsibility principle (SRP), DevOps, and gRPC, “a modern open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment.” [1] These practices enable architectures that make obsolescence issues smaller and more approachable. For instance, test hardware and software evolve as available hardware, and the development team's skillsets change over the lifetime of the tester and Unit Under Test (UUT). Using SRP allows individual engineers to troubleshoot isolated portions of complex systems without understanding the entire technology stack. Additionally, partitioning measurement tasks into measurement and analysis subtasks can maximize CPU power by offloading analysis from point-of-use test stations to higher-performance computers. This enables cost savings by removing number crunching from expensive testers and leveraging optimized high-performance computing for analysis tasks. We also show how gRPC natively incorporates low latency, security, and cross-platform interoperability between services. While it is impossible to prevent software, parts, and skills from becoming obsolete, it is possible to mitigate the risks to production through planning, procurement, and system design, including system software design. By walking in the footsteps of cloud computing, we can apply various techniques and technologies from the cloud to automated systems.",,978-1-7281-5400-8,10.1109/AUTOTESTCON47462.2022.9984719,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984719,Obsolescence;Cloud;Cloud Native;Service;Service Oriented Architecture,Cloud computing;Power measurement;Computer architecture;Production;Aging;Software;Hardware,,1.0,,14.0,IEEE,23 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Additionally, there is a trend for applications to be separated into microservices that run on different MEC Servers. This adds complexity to the placement of applications on the MEC Servers because it has to take into consideration the dependencies of its microservices. This problem is defined in the literature as the multi-component application placement problem. This paper proposes an algorithm to tackle this problem efficiently, while the dependencies of services are linear, i.e., a chain of microservices. The algorithm starts with the allocation of the 1-medlan of the backhaul network. Then, the proposed algorithm extends outwards and moves around until the score function stops improving.

Such a form of pervasive computing can not only make compute resources and information services universally available in such a way suitable for people's special uses but also bridge the digital information space and the physical world. However, given the properties of the smart space-each service with different resource requirements and goals, the smart space could cause resource conflicts in uses between different services and participants, and thus lead to the resource contention. In order to solve this problem while fulfilling the requirements of variable services in the smart space, in this paper, we leverage the concept of microservice to propose a universal resource scheduling and a process-evolution method for multiple concurrent services in the smart space. At the same time, to ensure that the microservice-based method is easy to implement, we also design a corresponding scheduling architecture based on the docker engine, which can functionally decompose application into a set of collaborative services. Finally, we carry out a experiment to show that the proposed architecture can achieve reasonable resource allocation, resolve resource contention, and exhibit the virtue of closed loop within different scenes and cross-scenario linkages.",,978-1-6654-2466-0,10.1109/BigDIA53151.2021.9619593,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619593,Smart space;Microservice;Resource scheduling;Process evolution,Pervasive computing;Couplings;Microservice architectures;Information services;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Sensors,,,,21.0,IEEE,6 Dec 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Although existing studies have made significant contributions towards achieving this objective, they primarily concentrate on static graphs. However, microservice graphs are inherently dynamic during runtime in production environments, necessitating more effective and scalable resource management solutions.In this paper, we present Derm, a new resource management system designed for microservice applications with highly dynamic graphs. Our principal finding is that prioritizing different microservice graphs can lead to a substantial reduction in resource allocation. To take advantage of this opportunity, we develop three main components. The first is a performance model that describes uncertainties of microservice latency through a conditional exponential distribution. The second is a probabilistic quantification of the dynamics of microservice graphs. The third is an optimization method for adjusting the resource allocation of microservices to minimize resource usage.

For example, when it comes to data-intensive cloud-native applications, the tenant might be eager to provision cloud resources in an economical manner while ensuring that the application performance meets the requirements in terms of data throughput. However, due to the complexity of the interplay between the building blocks, adequately setting resource limits of the components separately for various data rates is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach that consists of measuring the resource footprint and data throughput performance of such a microservices-based application, analyzing the measurement results by data mining techniques, and finally formulating an optimization problem that aims to minimize the allocated resources given the performance constraints. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach on Cortex, an extension to Prometheus for storing monitored metrics data. The data-intensive nature of this illustrative example stems from real-time monitoring of metrics exposed by a multitude of applications running in a data center and the continuous analysis performed on the collected data that can be fetched from Cortex. We present Cortex’s performance vs resource footprint trade-off, and then we build regression models to predict the microservices’ resource consumption and draw a mathematical programming formulation to optimize the most important configuration parameters. Our most important finding is the linear relationship between resource consumption and application performance, which allows for applying linear regression and linear programming models. After the optimization, we compare our results to Cortex’s recommendation, leading to a CPU reservation reduced by 50-80%.",2374-9709,978-1-6654-0601-7,10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789857,Innovation Fund; Innovation Fund; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789857,cloud-native;microservices;performance;re-source footprint;optimization,Measurement;Cloud computing;Biological system modeling;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Throughput;Brain modeling,,1.0,,15.0,IEEE,9 Jun 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Grunt Attack utilizes legitimate HTTP requests to accurately profile the internal pairwise dependencies of all supported execution paths in the target system. By grouping and characterizing all the execution paths based on their pairwise dependencies, the Grunt attacker can target only a few execution paths to launch a low-volume DDoS attack that achieves large performance damage to the entire system. To increase the attack stealthiness, the Grunt attacker avoids creating a persistent bottleneck by alternating the target execution paths within their dependency group. We validate the effectiveness of Grunt attack through experiments of open-source microservices benchmark applications on real clouds (e.g., EC2, Azure) equipped with state-of-the-art IDS/IPS systems and live attack scenarios.

Microservices-based software architecture and approaches,K. Bakshi,"Cisco Systems Inc, Herndon, VA",2017 IEEE Aerospace Conference,8 Jun 2017,2017,,,1,8,"In the last few years, a revised software architecture style has been developed to design new software applications. This architecture style is particularly suited for use cases in the aerospace industry, from an independently deployable software service. The microservices architectural style develops a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. These services are built around business and mission capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated machinery. With microservices, some types of applications become easier to build and maintain when they are broken down into smaller, composable pieces that work together. Each component is then developed separately, and the application is then simply the sum of its constituent components. This is in contrast to a traditional, “monolithic” application which is all developed in one piece.

Currently, there are a few SDKs released by some public Cloud service providers to support the development of Fog services in a top-down fashion as the key motive is to leverage their business Cloud services. However, Fog Computing systems are usually designed in a bottom-up fashion as the major functionalities are centred around the Edge Nodes and the End Devices.

In this paper, we compare the performance of both approaches using an analytic model and implementing test-bed experiments. In addition, we calculate the number of instances of monoliths or microservices in which a network function could be scaled or decomposed in order to get the maximum or required performance. Single and multiple CPU core scenarios are considered. Experimentation is performed by using an open source network function, SNORT and running monoliths and microservices of SNORT as Docker containers on bare metal machines.

Orchestration is a requirement of Fog Computing technology to deliver services, based on the composition of microservices. It must take into consideration the heterogeneity of the IoT environment and device's capabilities and constraints. This heterogeneity requires a different approach for orchestration, be it regarding infrastructure management, node selection and/or service placement. Orchestrations shall be manually or automatically started through event triggers. Also, the Orchestrator must be flexible enough to work in a centralized or distributed fashion. Orchestration is still a hot topic and can be seen in different areas, especially in the Service Oriented Architectures, hardware virtualization, in the Cloud, and in Network Virtualization Function. However, the architecture of these solutions is not enough to handle Fog Requirements, specially Fog's heterogeneity, and dynamics.

However, in testing environments, the available trace is often sparse, and the system is continuously upgrading, which renders existing microservice-based root cause analysis (RCA) ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SparseRCA. By assessing the abnormality of the exclusive latency, SparseRCA directly determines the probability of the root cause, solving the challenge of not being able to fully obtain the fault propagation information, such as call relationships in sparse trace scenarios. At the same time, by reconstructing the exclusive latency using the decoupled atomic span units, it solves the problem of latency prediction for new traces caused by frequent upgrades.

One of the best ways to design microservices is to decompose a monolithic prototype of an application into microservices on the basis of both the complexity in engineering and the component boundaries of the application in the early phase of development. We propose a visualization tool allowing developers to interactively design microservice applications on the basis of the characteristics of source codes and the behaviors of a monolithic prototype. This visualization tool first constructs a calling-context tree from profile data taken in a dry-run of the application. Next, it generates an initial microservice design while considering keyword features in the source codes or amount of function calls between components. Developers can interactively refine this design via this visual interface by taking four-choice actions to revise boundaries of microservices while considering expected communications between them. This interaction will have a significant impact on runtime performance.

Adopting service-oriented concepts like Service Oriented Architecture or Microservice Architecture requires tackling challenges like service granularity, (de)composition, etc. For instance, too coarse-grained services could lead to significant drawbacks, while too fine-grained services could increase the system's overall complexity, introducing semantic tight coupling and bringing about communication overhead.

While it is desirable to use these tools as part of larger decision support systems (DSSs) doing so is often not straightforward, as their design does not often support external interoperability or account for the fact that other CIG tools may be running in parallel, a situation that will become increasingly more prevalent with the increased adoption of CIGs in different parts of the health system. This results in an integration overhead, system redundancy and a lack of flexibility in how these tools can be combined. To address these issues, we define a blueprint architecture to be used in the design of guideline processing tools, based on the conceptualisation of key components as RESTful microservices.

In practice, microservice architectures can be employed, which may consist of containerized microservices running in a cluster comprised of robots and supporting infrastructure. These microservices need to be orchestrated dynamically according to ever changing requirements posed at the system. Additionally, these systems are embedded in DevOps processes aiming at continually updating and upgrading both the capabilities of CPS components and of the system as a whole. In this paper, we present RobotKube, an approach to orchestrating containerized microservices for large-scale cooperative multi-robot CPS based on Kubernetes. We describe how to automate the orchestration of software across a CPS, and include the possibility to monitor and selectively store relevant accruing data. In this context, we present two main components of such a system: an event detector capable of, e.g., requesting the deployment of additional applications, and an application manager capable of automatically configuring the required changes in the Kubernetes cluster. By combining the widely adopted Kubernetes platform with the Robot Operating System (ROS), we enable the use of standard tools and practices for developing, deploying, scaling, and monitoring microservices in C-ITS.

Microservices especially have been widely used to deliver IoT services due to their lightweight implementation and distributed nature. With the continuous increase in IoT services available on the Internet, the selection of services becomes difficult. Furthermore, IoT services are often featured with rich contexts and OpenAPI descriptions, which impede service recommendation approaches that are designed for WSDL-based Web services or mashup services. To address this challenging issue, we propose a context-aware IoT service recommendation approach called DFORM for proactive service provision. DFORM considers both functional features of OpenAPI descriptions and contextual features of IoT environments, and leverages a deep collaborative filtering-based recommendation model to learn the feature representations and capture the interactions between users and services. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the recommendation performance of DFORM and the experimental results show that DFORM is effective in IoT service recommendation and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.",,978-1-6654-8143-4,10.1109/ICWS55610.2022.00035,National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9885270,service recommendation;Internet of Things;IoT services;context-awareness;microservice architecture,Mashups;Collaboration;Microservice architectures;Information filters;Internet of Things;Context modeling,,6.0,,35.0,IEEE,16 Sep 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

While addressing these communication challenges, implementing service mesh solutions introduces higher resource utilization, primarily due to deploying an additional per-microservice infrastructure known as the “sidecar” container. A sidecarless approach, as exemplified by Cilium, leverages extended Berkeley packet filter (eBPF) technology to minimize operational overhead and optimize resource utilization. The advent of data processing units (DPU) represents a crucial evolution in cloud accelerators, designed to offload and accelerate networking, security, and storage tasks traditionally handled by server CPUs. This demonstration integrates DPU technology with Cilium’s sidecarless architecture and proposes to offload Cilium’s control plane to DPUs. Our proposed approach improves system efficiency by deploying Cilium’s control plane components on DPUs in a separate host mode.

In this paper, we address the issue of shared vulnerabilities in microservices with a novel solution based on the concept of Moving Target Defenses (MTD). Our mechanism works by performing risk analysis against microservices to detect and prioritize vulnerabilities. Thereafter, security risk-oriented software diversification is employed, guided by a defined diversification index. The diversification is performed at runtime, leveraging both model and template based automatic code generation techniques to automatically transform programming languages and container images of the microservices. Consequently, the microservices attack surfaces are altered thereby introducing uncertainty for attackers while reducing the attackability of the microservices.

Efficient scheduling and resource allocation for these microservices play a pivotal role in achieving high performance and maintaining system reliability. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for container scheduling within Kubernetes clusters, leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for representation learning. Our proposed method captures the intricate dependencies among containers and services by constructing a representation graph.

These highly granular components are referred to as microservices and can be dynamically deployed on Docker containers. These microservice architecture systems are very extensible since new microservices can be added or replaced as the system evolves. In such highly granular architectures, a major challenge that arises is how to quickly identify whether any changes in the system’s structure violates any policies or design constraints. Examples of policies and design constraints include whether a microservice can call or pass data to another microservice, and whether data handled by one microservice can be stored in a specific database. In order to perform such type of analysis a model that denotes call and data dependencies between microservices must be constructed. In this paper, we present a technique that is based on log analysis and probabilistic reasoning to yield a labeled, typed, directed multigraph that represents call and data exchanges between microservices in a given deployment. This dependency graph can serve as input to analysis engines to be used for identifying design and policy violations as the system evolves or being updated. The proposed dependency graph creation approach has been applied to a medium size open source microservice system with very promising results.",,978-1-6654-8864-8,10.1109/STC55697.2022.00020,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951030,Microservices;log analysis;component dependencies;reasoning;formal concept analysis,Source coding;Microservice architectures;Process control;Markov processes;Probabilistic logic;Cognition;Servers,,1.0,,17.0,IEEE,18 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This paper introduces a challenging task called global diagnosis and addresses it by proposing a technique called G-Cause, which is applicable to both Service-level and host-level root cause analysis scenarios. G-Cause builds a highly adaptive diagnostic framework based on the frequency-domain and time-domain characteristics of monitoring metrics, allowing it to handle global diagnosis requirements from app to host with minimal parameter adjustments. We deploy and validate our approach in two typical scenarios: homogeneous metric diagnosis from app to microservice, and heterogeneous metric diagnosis for various host resources. The results demonstrate that G-Cause outperforms state-of-the-art diagnosis algorithms while providing strong interpretability.

Self Adjusting Log Observability for Cloud Native Applications,D. Pathak; M. Verma; A. Chakraborty; H.

This is further exacerbated by extensive cloud deployments, where observability is crucial for comprehending the health and performance of these systems, leading operations teams to collect as much data as possible for the “fear of missing out”. However, the collection, storage, and analysis of observability data entail significant costs, both in terms of resources and finances. Specifically, logs comprise the most substantial portion of observability data volume, thus exerting the greatest impact on observability cost. Moreover, logs also exhibit unstructured and noisy characteristics, where the efficacy of downstream AI for IT operations (AIOps tasks or Day-2 operations), such as fault classification, fault diagnosis, log anomaly detection etc., can be negatively impacted by log data volume. Hence, striking a balance between the verbosity of log observability and its impact on day-2 operations and debuggability is essential. In this paper, we introduce an autonomous system named SALO, which stands for Self-Adjusting Log Observability. SALO selectively collects logs based on real-time necessity, location, and granularity, as opposed to the conventional practice of collecting indiscriminately from all the components continuously. Our experiments show that SALO drastically decreases the log volume, by as much as 95 %, while still maintaining data quality for downstream AIOps usage, especially for post-hoc diagnosis tasks. Operating on a reduced volume of log data not only decreases storage, transfer, and retention costs but also streamlines observability pipelines, making them leaner, more efficient, and less resource-hungry.",2159-6190,979-8-3503-6853-6,10.1109/CLOUD62652.2024.00061,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643920,Observability;Log Volume;AIOps,Fault diagnosis;Cloud computing;Costs;Data integrity;Pipelines;Microservice architectures;Real-time systems,,,,45.0,IEEE,28 Aug 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, loosely-coupling does not mean multiple microservices keep absolutely independent but there are more or less dependencies among them, and such dependencies occur not only on functionalities but also on the version issue, too.

Due to the rapid increase in the use of information in the digital age of the 21st century, it is increasingly becoming a more attractive option for individuals and organizations to manage all their essential data, projects, and collaborations, rather than relying solely on in-house computers. The user's requirement for hardware and software is reduced via cloud computing. The interface software of cloud computing systems, typically as simple as a web browser, is the only thing the user must operate, and the Cloud network handles the rest. To decrease operational costs, both business and government organizations are adopting cloud computing, seeking a flexible and adaptable solution for the supply and delivery of their product services. Microservices and decoupled apps are becoming more popular. These container-based architectures make it easier to build sophisticated SaaS apps quickly, but managing and creating microservices can be a daunting task. Managing and creating microservices that involve a wide range of diverse functions, including handling and storing information, and performing predictive and prescriptive analysis, can be a challenging undertaking. Establishing auto scaling infrastructure on doud can be challenging due to several reasons, some of which are: understanding the application architecture, setting up monitoring, scaling policies, cost optimization and implementation complexity. Server farms include the tremendous and heterogeneous virtualized frameworks, which are continually extending and broadening after sometime are the essential starting point for registering specialized organizations. These solutions also need to be integrated into existing systems while adhering to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. The principal objective of this work is to propose an on-premise design to leverage Kubernetes and Docker containers to improve the quality of service based on resource usage and Service Level Objectives (SLOs). The Prometheus Administrator set up is used to perform namespace checking. Normally, doud providers enable their own monitoring tools (like CloudWatch) for monitoring CPU, storage and network usage, service component, however these tools cannot monitor the service component. Additionally, the advancements have restricted the capacity to follow QoS highlights at the application level (like security and execution) since the main focus will be dedicated towards the equipment assets. These types of node-level monitoring make it difficult to scale requests and deploy pods to match the demand. Infrastructure monitoring should enable runtime changes to monitor the requirements or metric operationalization should be done on those criteria without modifying the underlying infrastructure.",,978-1-6654-6408-6,10.1109/ICCMC56507.2023.10083635,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083635,Software as a Service;Service-Level Objective;Prometheus;Microservices;Monitoring tool;Quality of Service,Cloud computing;Costs;Linux;Software as a service;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Planning,,1.0,,20.0,IEEE,4 Apr 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this scenario, every Cloud Service Provider(CSP) ensures that they are responsible for securing the data at rest. But the data in transit is left to the user’s responsibility. Some prominent Cloud Service Providers offer services to encrypt the data in-transit as well.

Kubernetes is one of the most popular container orchestration tools currently available, which can effectively simplify container management. The scheduler is a core component of Kubernetes, which is responsible for scheduling containers to run on the most appropriate node. The main reference metric for the Kubernetes default scheduler is the resource request rate of the node. It prioritizes scheduling containers to run on nodes with low resource request rates. The resource application rate of a node is calculated by dividing the amount of resources requested by the node by the total amount of resources of the node. This scheduling strategy can meet business requirements in most cases, but it may have problems in certain scenarios. In a certain business scenario, the data processing module of the system needs to run multiple processing tasks on multiple nodes, and the computing resources required for these processing tasks vary. When using the default scheduler, it is difficult for users to predict their actual needs when applying for resources. Therefore, there may be significant differences between the resource application rate of nodes and the actual resource utilization rate of nodes, resulting in significant waste of cluster resources and uneven load. Therefore, this article refers to the relevant research results in the field of Kubernetes scheduling and implements a scheduler based on real load, aiming to solve the possible resource waste and load imbalance when scheduling Pods by default schedulers.",,979-8-3503-1667-4,10.1109/EIECS59936.2023.10435549,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10435549,Kubernetes;Scheduler;Scheduling policy,Processor scheduling;Microservice architectures;Containers;Resource management;Task analysis;Optimization;Business,,,,5.0,IEEE,21 Feb 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As Telcos have adopted IMS as the de facto platform for service delivery in 3G and even 4G systems, it is interesting to study its evolution for 5G towards a microservices-based architecture with an optimal design. Therefore, we consider IMS as a case of study to illustrate the proposed approach. We present new functional entities for IMS-as-a-Service through a functional decomposition of legacy network functions. We have developed and implemented IMS-as-a-Service with respect to the proposed requirements. We consider a service scenario where we focus on authentication and authorization procedures. We evaluate the involved microservices comparing to the state-of-the-art.

Synchronous Reconfiguration of Distributed Embedded Applications During Operation,K. Telschig; A.

The key to speed is to enable agile development by independent engineer offices and equipment producers with industrial-grade microservice architectures. The expensive drawback is: While software components evolve over time, manufacturers have to integrate and deploy more and more updates during costly production stops. To avoid production stops as much as possible, we propose reconfiguration extensions to a real-time container architecture proposed earlier. The original container approach addresses both the functional and nonfunctional aspects of integrating embedded software components in late engineering phases. The extended approach allows modifications of the running distributed embedded application even during operation, while continuously ensuring reactivity of the system. The agents running on each node prepare the reconfiguration in background and then synchronously perform the required modifications according to a detailed reconfiguration plan. We demonstrate our concept by describing a synchronous API change between two distributed software components of a running gesture recognition system.

Software containers and orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, have simplified the development and management of microservices. To manage containers' horizontal elasticity, Kubernetes uses a decentralized threshold-based policy that requires to set thresholds on system-oriented metrics (i.e., CPU utilization). This might not be well-suited to scale latency-sensitive applications, which need to express requirements in terms of response time. Moreover, being a fully decentralized solution, it may lead to frequent and uncoordinated application reconfigurations. In this paper, we present me-kube (Multi-level Elastic Kubernetes), a Kubernetes extension that introduces a hierarchical architecture for controlling the elasticity of microservice-based applications. At higher level, a centralized per-application component coordinates the run-time adaptation of subordinated distributed components, which, in turn, locally control the adaptation of each microservice. Then, we propose novel proactive and reactive hierarchical control policies, based on queuing theory. To show that me-kube provides general mechanisms, we also integrate reinforcement learning-based scaling policies.

However, the increasing complexity of future networks calls for sophisticated platforms that could help network providers with their deployments design. In this framework, a central research trend is the development of digital twins of the physical infrastructures.

This paper proposes a vision for how we may build IoT systems in the future by reconceiving IoT's fundamental unit of construction not as a ""thing"", but rather as a widely and finely distributed ""microservice"" already familiar to web service engineering circles. Since IoT systems are quite different from more established uses of microservice architectures, success of the approach depends on adaptations that enable them to met the key challenges that IoT systems present. We argue that a microservice approach to building IoT systems can combine in a mutually enforcing way with patterns for microservices, API gateways, distribution of services, uniform service discovery, containers, and access control. The approach is illustrated using two case studies of IoT systems in personal health management and connected autonomous vehicles.

A particular challenge is to monitor state updates from the distributed CPS components: one needs to ensure that only states consistent with the PDDL plan execution semantics can be observed within the system. In order to guarantee that, a component to monitor plan execution is proposed. Microservices based on Linked Data technologies are used to provide a uniform way to access component states, represented as Resource Description Framework (RDF) resources.

These techniques, at large, construct a graph-based representation of an application and cluster its elements into service candidates. The techniques vary by their decomposition goals and, subsequently, types of relationships between application elements that they consider - structural, semantic term similarity, and evolutionary - with each technique utilizing a fixed subset and weighting of these relationship types.In this paper, we perform a multi-method exploratory study with 10 industrial practitioners to investigate (1) the applicability and usefulness of different relationships types during the microservice extraction process and (2) expectations practitioners have for tools utilizing such relationships. Our results show that practitioners often need a ""what-if"" analysis tool that simultaneously considers multiple relationship types during the extraction process and that there is no fixed way to weight these relationships. Our study also identifies organization- and application-specific considerations that lead practitioners to prefer certain relationship types over others, e.g., the age of the codebase and languages spoken in the organization.

Due to its capacity to decouple communication entities in time, space, and synchronization, it is a useful interaction mechanism for large-scale distributed systems. Rather than interacting directly with one another, services in the pub/sub pattern can communicate through a message broker. This approach separates the concerns of publishers and subscribers, allowing publishers to concentrate just on publishing and subscribers to concentrate solely on the publications to which they are subscribed. The resulting structure enables asynchronous message sending and receiving by a task-specific broker, which is one of the various approaches to construct event-based systems. Because of their unique qualities, including data-centricity, dynamicity, and many-to-many communications, the decoupling properties are well-suited for Microservices. Components of a monolithic application call each other using language-level method or function calls. A microservices-based application, on the other hand, is a distributed system that runs on numerous machines. Typically, each service instance is a process. There are numerous advantages to using the Microservices Architecture design. It begins by addressing the issue of complexity. It breaks down what would otherwise be a massive monolithic application into a series of services. While the overall functionality of the application has not changed, it has been divided into digestible parts or services. A significant disadvantage of microservices is the increased complexity that comes with being a distributed system. Developers must choose and implement a messaging or Remote procedure call-based interprocess communication mechanism. As a result, services must communicate through the interprocess communication (IPC) method.

This proximity lets edge computing support emerging 5G application scenarios that need low latency and high bandwidth (e.g., augmented reality, autonomous vehicles). Given its interest, edge computing is fastly gaining momentum and is currently being standardised by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). Notwithstanding its strengths, edge computing is significantly challenged by device mobility, as this can reduce proximity to the edge microservice, putting edge computing benefits at risk. A way to solve this problem is to migrate the edge microservice across edge servers, to let it follow the application component running on the mobile device. Besides, if the microservice is stateful (i.e., it maintains a state associated to the user), its state needs to be migrated as well. Within ETSI MEC, this concept is expressed as stateful application relocation. The standard identifies three different high-level ways to transfer the application state. However, all of them assume that it is up to the application to actually relocate the state. In this work, we assume that applications at the edge run as containers, and we extend ETSI MEC to let it support stateful application relocation by leveraging container migration techniques. This approach allows to transfer the application state in a transparent way to the application itself. We implemented our solution and tested it over a small-scale edge computing testbed to extract initial results.",,978-1-6654-0876-9,10.1109/WoWMoM54355.2022.00035,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842789,Edge computing;ETSI MEC;mobility;migration;QUIC,Wireless communication;Multi-access edge computing;ETSI;Microservice architectures;Containers;Mobile handsets;Servers,,9.0,,31.0,IEEE,9 Aug 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Basically, IoT is a platform where integrated services are associated with the common network, thus all devices are able to gather and exchange data among each other. Typically, monolithic user mobility research services are developed for the unified ETSI MEC system reference architecture centers. ETSI MEC considers microservices as a tool for breaking monolithic applications into a set of loosely coupled distributed components. It is expected that this architecture will facilitate the dynamic adaptation during the application execution. However, increased modularity can also increase the burden on orchestration and system management. In MEC, user hardware is connected through gateways to microservices running on the edge host.There are three levels in each of the edge systems: 1) microservices perform a logical operation with components for motion track analysis, 2) movement foresight and 3) outcome visualization. The distributed service is realized with Docker containers and calculated on actual world adjustment with low capacity edge servers and real user mobility information. The results demonstrate the fact that the edge perspective of low latency may be encountered in this sort of implementation. The integration of a software creation technology with a standardized edge system supplies respectable basis for subsequent development.

With constant improvement of the Internet of Things, real-time systems needed different software architectures and communication systems to enable their remote operation, with the same degree of flexibility when operating the systems in-situ.

Since application workloads usually change over time, the number of replicas per microservice should be accordingly scaled at run-time. The most widely adopted scaling policy relies on statically defined thresholds, expressed in terms of system-oriented metrics. This policy might not be well-suited to scale multi-component and latency-sensitive applications, which express requirements in terms of response time. In this paper, we present a two-layered hierarchical solution for controlling the elasticity of microservice-based applications. The higher-level controller estimates the microservice contribution to the application performance, and informs the lower-level components. The latter accordingly scale the single microservices using a dynamic threshold-based policy. So, we propose MB Threshold and QL Threshold, two policies that employ respectively model-based and model-free reinforcement learning approaches to learn threshold update strategies. These policies can compute different thresholds for the different application components, according to the desired deployment objectives.

It is essential but challenging to localize root-cause microservices promptly when a fault occurs. Traces are helpful for root-cause microservice localization, and thus many recent approaches utilize them. However, these approaches are less practical due to relying on supervision or other unrealistic assumptions. To overcome their limitations, we propose a more practical root-cause microservice localization approach named TraceRCA. The key insight of TraceRCA is that a microservice with more abnormal and less normal traces passing through it is more likely to be the root cause. Based on it, TraceRCA is composed of trace anomaly detection, suspicious microservice set mining and microservice ranking. We conducted experiments on hundreds of injected faults in a widely-used open-source microservice benchmark and a production system. The results show that TraceRCA is effective in various situations. The top-1 accuracy of TraceRCA outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches by 44.8%. Besides, TraceRCA is applied in a large commercial bank, and it helps operators localize root causes for real-world faults accurately and efficiently.

However, the incumbent components and interfaces of the 5G core (5GC) pose barriers to the seamless integration of microservices. Challenges range from intricate Network Functions (NF) interdependencies to interface constraints and the absence of an event-driven architecture, which might jeopardise efficient microservice communication. This paper discusses the interplay between the Network Exposure Function (NEF) and the Common API Framework (CAPIF), defined by 3GPP, to standardize how network APIs are discovered, exposed, and consumed. First, we propose a novel microservice and eventdriven Network Exposure Function (MNEF) built upon the NEF standard, featuring CAPIF support and various purpose-built microservices. Then, we evaluate its interoperability with reference implementations of 5GC (Open5GS) and CAPIF (OpenCAPIF) and its performance and scalability for handling large-scale request scenarios. The results attest to the MNEF's benefits and interoperability with compliant 5GC implementations. Despite an additional (expected) overhead in communications, MNEF fulfils its purpose as defined in the 5G architecture, acting as an interface between external parties and 5G core NFs. Moreover, the proposed MNEF presents itself as a design solution that pushes the scalable 5G communication boundaries.",,979-8-3503-7859-7,10.1109/6GNet63182.2024.10765765,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10765765,,6G mobile communication;Technological innovation;5G mobile communication;Scalability;Microservice architectures;Robustness;Noise measurement;Interoperability;Standards;Optimization,,,,11.0,IEEE,2 Dec 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As these methodologies gain traction, they introduce a transformative shift within the cloud computing landscape. At the forefront of this shift is the synergy between container technology and microservice architecture, promising to significantly enhance both efficiency and agility across industries. Nonetheless, this transfor-mation also adds complexity and enlarges the system attack surface, introducing additional vulnerabilities susceptible to being exploited by well-informed and resourceful attackers, especially in case of static defense techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Moving Target Defense (MTD) approach, which proactively intervenes on the lifecycle of cloud-native application components. Such dynamicity serves as deterrent to potential adversaries, making persistence harder, lowering the effectiveness of automated attack tools, and increasing overall complexity and cost. We detail a step-by-step path, ranging from simple to advanced MTD techniques, targeting both stateless and stateful applications within a cloud-native environment.

A Toolbox for Realtime Timeseries Anomaly Detection,M. böbel; I. Gerostathopoulos; T.

Data-driven decisions are taken either by humans or by software agents via analyzing streams of timeseries data coming from different running systems. Since the quality of sensed data influences the analysis and subsequent decision-making, detecting data anomalies is an important and necessary part of any data analysis and data intelligence pipeline (such as those typically found in smart and self-adaptive systems). Although a number of data science libraries exist for timeseries anomaly detection, it is both time consuming and hard to plug realtime anomaly detection functionality in existing pipelines. The problem lies with the boilerplate code that needs to be provided for common tasks such as data ingestion, data transformation and preprocessing, invoking of model re-training when needed, and persisting of identified anomalies so that they can be acted upon or further analysed. In response, we created a toolbox for realtime anomaly detection that automates the above common tasks and modularizes the anomaly detection process in a number of clearly defined components. This serves as a plug-in solution for architecting and development of smart systems that have to adapt their behavior at runtime. In this paper, we describe the microservice architecture used by our toolbox and explain how to deploy it for obtaining an out-of-the-box solution for realtime anomaly detection out of ready-to-use components.

From these models, activities that allow such migration are carefully selected and identified. In order to implement and evaluate the activities proposed in those models, an application that initially does not have any structure at the design and coding level (using PHP programming language) is applied. Then, the application's coding language changes to Java and the classes and libraries are distributed into packages.

When users access microservices, their initial point of contact is typically a load balancer. This component is responsible for distributing incoming traffic or requests between multiple instances of microservices. Traditional load balancing approaches mainly rely on round-robin, or weighted roundrobin algorithms which are inadequate to maintain the overall performance and scalability of microservice-based applications. Microservices are often deployed in dynamic environments needing a more adaptive and efficient load balancing strategy to optimize resources and reduce the overall latency for end users. This paper presents a dynamic load balancer for Kubernetes (K8s) clusters based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). It aims to minimize the overall latency while promoting fair distribution of requests. To achieve this goal, the load balancer considers both current network delays and processing loads in the cluster. The evaluation shows that our solution is effective even in environments where both the network traffic and the processing loads in the cluster change dynamically over time. In addition, this study highlights the flexibility of DeepSets neural networks in solving the load balancing challenge in diverse setups without retraining. The results show that the DeepSets algorithms can solve the microservice load balancing problem even in scenarios up to 30 times larger than the trained setup.",2637-9430,979-8-3503-8461-1,10.1109/ICCCN61486.2024.10637606,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10637606,Load Balancing;Reinforcement Learning;Microservices;Kubernetes;Containers,Heuristic algorithms;Scalability;Neural networks;Microservice architectures;Reinforcement learning;Telecommunication traffic;Containers,,1.0,,31.0,IEEE,22 Aug 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Nevertheless, while microservices can be used to develop new applications, there are monolithic ones, that are not well adapted neither to the cloud nor to DevOps. Migrating these applications towards microservices appears as a solution to adapt them to both. In this context, we propose an approach aiming to achieve this objective by focusing on the step of microservices identification. The proposed identification, in this paper, is based on an analysis of the relationships between source code elements, their relationships with the persistent data manipulated in this code and finally the knowledge, often partial, of the architect concerning the system to migrate. A function that measures the quality of a microservice based on its ability to provide consistent service and its interdependence with others microservice in the resulting architecture was defined. Moreover, the architect recommendations are used, when available, to guide the identification process.

Current infrastructure network conditions and resource availability neither run time application state are taken into account when scheduling microservices. To deal with these limitations in this work we present an extension of the Kubernetes platform in order to implement an effective application and infrastructure-aware container scheduling and orchestration strategy.

The approach is based on three key components: implementing analysis processes as independent microservices, using a publish-subscribe communication system, and implementing automatic scaling mechanisms. These factors enable a flexible, robust, and scalable analysis pipeline. It can dynamically adapt to changing workloads and ensure optimal resource utilization.",,979-8-3503-2771-7,10.1109/SMAP59435.2023.10255189,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10255189,,Social networking (online);Communication systems;Scalability;Pipelines;Blogs;Microservice architectures;Publish-subscribe,,,,15.0,IEEE,26 Sep 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

A Provenance-Aware Approach to Big Data Workflow Management in Heterogeneous Cloud Environments,A. Kashliev; K. Tracy,"Department of Computer Science, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, USA; Department of Computer Science, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, USA",2024 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA),28 Jun 2024,2024,,,113,119,"Big data workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm that enables researchers and practitioners to run complex multi-step computational processes in the cloud to gain insight into their large datasets. To create a workflow, a user logs on to a specialized software, called Big Data Workflow Management System, or simply BDW system, to select and connect together various components, or tasks, into a workflow. The workflow is then mapped onto a set of distributed compute resources, such as Virtual Machines (VMs), and storage resources, such as S3 buckets and EBS volumes. It is then executed, with different branches and tasks of the workflow running in parallel on different nodes. During execution, the BDW system captures provenance, which is the history of data derivation that describes data processing steps that yielded each output result. Workflow management, including workflow composition and schedule refinement, is a challenging problem. This problem is further exacerbated by the growing number and heterogeneity of workflow tasks and cloud resources, as well as by the growing size and complexity of workflow structures. Few efforts were made to leverage provenance for facilitating workflow composition and schedule refinement. To address these issues, we 1) produce a comprehensive conceptual model for big data workflow provenance that captures the complexity and heterogeneity of cloud-based workflow execution, 2) propose a scalable Cassandra database schema for provenance-aware workflow composition and schedule refinement, 3) outline a four-step provenance-based schedule refinement process for balancing workflow execution time and cost, and 4) present a scalable and highly available microservices-based reference architecture for big data workflow management in the cloud.

In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices.

In this article, we share our learning of converting a distributed software to a microservice-based architecture using containers. Though the existing system has a modular design and deployed as distributed components, analysis of the current architecture shows that the application is monolithic (though modularized) and the components are strongly coupled in an indirect manner. As a result, it turns to be impossible to attain microservice-based architecture without changing the architecture. Next, we propose a microservice-based containerized TO-BE architecture of the application, and demonstrate that this TO-BE architecture does not incur any significant overhead.

Due to the introduction of the virtualization layer and the decoupling of the network functions and their running infrastructure, the operation models need to include new elements like virtual network functions (VNFs) and a new set of relationships between them and the NFV Infrastructure (NFVI). The NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) framework plays the key role in managing and orchestrating the NFV infrastructure, network services and the associated VNFs. Failures of the MANO hinders the network ability to react to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services.

Docker is one of the leading container technologies that automate the deployment of applications into containers. Docker Hub is a public repository by Docker for storing and sharing the Docker images. These Docker images are pulled from the Docker Hub repository and the security of images being used from the repositories in any cloud environment could be at risk.

It provides visibility into the full life cycle of a request or operation across multiple services, which is essential for understanding system dependencies and performance bottlenecks. To mitigate computational and storage overheads, most tracing frameworks adopt a uniform sampling strategy, which inevitably captures overlapping and redundant information. More advanced methods employ learning-based approaches to bias the sampling toward more informative traces. However, existing methods fall short of considering the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of trace data, which is essential for the production deployment of trace sampling. To address these practical challenges, in this paper we present Trace Mesh,a scalable and streaming sampler for distributed traces. Tracemesh employs Locality-Sensitivity Hashing (LSH) to improve sampling efficiency by projecting traces into a low-dimensional space while preserving their similarity. In this process, Tracemesh accommodates previously unseen trace features in a unified and streamlined way. Subsequently, Tracemesh samples traces through evolving clustering, which dynamically adjusts the sampling decision to avoid over-sampling of recurring traces. The proposed method is evaluated with trace data collected from both open-source microservice benchmarks and production service systems.

Philippsen,"QAware GmbH, Munich, Germany; Programming Systems Group, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany",2021 Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT),11 Nov 2021,2021,,,55,64,"Especially with the rise of microservice architectures, software is hard to understand when just the static dependencies are known. The reason is that the actual call paths and the dynamic behavior of the application is hidden behind network communication. To comprehend what is going on in the software the vast amount of runtime data (traces) needs to be reduced and visualized.DynaCity uses the city metaphor for visualization. Its novel trace visualization displays dynamic dependencies as arcs atop the city. To reduce the number of traces, DynaCity aggregates all requests between the same two components into one arc whose brightness reflects both the number and the total duration of the requests. DynaCity also encodes dynamic trace data in a heatmap that it uses to light up the building: the brighter a building is, the more active it is, i.e., the more and the longer the requests are that it receives and/or spawns.In a controlled experiment, we compare our approach with a traditional trace visualization built into the same Software City but showing all dependencies (without aggregation) as individual arcs and also disabling the heatmap. The study shows that professional software developers can solve typical software comprehension tasks faster (5.84%) and more correctly (11.7%) with the help of DynaCity and that they prefer our approach over the more traditional dynamic trace visualization.",,978-1-6654-3144-6,10.1109/VISSOFT52517.2021.00015,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604832,trace visualization;software city;program comprehension;aggregation;heatmap,Heating systems;Runtime;Aggregates;Urban areas;Brightness;Data visualization;Computer architecture,,4.0,,25.0,IEEE,11 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Pipekit: A Deployment Tool with Advanced Scheduling and Inter-Service Communication for Multi-Tier Applications,P. Chico de Guzmán; F. Gorostiaga; C. Sánchez,"IMDEA Software Institute, Spain; IMDEA Software Institute, Spain; IMDEA Software Institute, Spain",2018 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS),6 Sep 2018,2018,,,379,382,"Modern cloud applications are based on microservice architectures. The deployment of these microservice based applications often requires that every constituent service starts after all its dependencies are configured and running properly. It is also common that these dependencies generate dynamic data that needs to be supplied to other services too at starting time. More complex scenarios require additionally interchanging data in other phases of the microservices lifecycle. One alternative to solve these dependencies is to describe the deployment of microservice applications manually—using scripts—which allows IT operators to precisely define when a service is ready to start serving other components. However, synchronization by scripting is tedious, error prone and hard to maintain. Other solutions offer specific languages to describe service dependencies, along with tool support that interpret scripts in these languages to take care of starting services in the proper order. These tools are either very rich but complex to use, or fail in providing sophisticated ways to describe what it means for a service to be ready. Moreover, the communication layer between services, if supplied, is based on intermediate entities and non-trivial network protocols. This paper proposes pipekit as a solution, by offering a container orchestration language which focuses on simplicity (pipekit is similar to Docker Compose) and is equipped with directives to define when a service is ready. The pipekit tool provides a communication layer for moving data between services, implemented using shared storage. This shared storage provides a very simple interface to move artifacts between services, and greatly simplifies the synchronization logic of pipekit by using semaphores at the file system level.",,978-1-5386-7247-1,10.1109/ICWS.2018.00066,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456383,orchestration;microservices;deployment;syncronization,Databases;Tools;Containers;Synchronization;Pipelines;Software;Protocols,,2.0,,13.0,IEEE,6 Sep 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, with the development of the Internet of Things, data are collected, processed, and stored in a distributed manner, leading a new optimization paradigm for SAEAs. To make SAEAs adapt to these distributed DOPs, this paper employs the edge computing paradigm to develop a platform that provides technical support for SAEAs with distributed structures, named ECdo. Specifically, the platform utilizes KubeEdge, an open-source edge computing framework, to mount the cluster and combines microservice interface design with the containerization strategy to offer a flexible deployment approach for distributed SAEAs. In addition, an efficient and stable internal communication mechanism is designed for the interaction between distributed components within the platform. To demonstrate the application of ECdo, we take the examples of a class of distributed DOPs, in which the objective and constraints are expensive and need to be approximated by accumulated data.

Microservice architecture also becomes the de facto choice for designing a modern Cloud Native Network Function (CNF) due to its ability to decouple components of each CNF into multiple independently manageable microservices. Even though taking advantage of microservice architecture in designing CNFs solves specific problems, this additional granularity makes estimating resource requirements for a Production Environment (PE) a complex task and sometimes leads to an over-provisioned PE. Traditionally, performance engineers dimension each CNF within a Service Function Chain (SFC) in a smaller Performance Testing Environment (PTE) through a series of performance benchmarks. Then, considering the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints of a Service Provider (SP) that are guaranteed in the Service Level Agreement (SLA), they estimate the required resources to set up the PE. In this paper, we used a machine learning approach to model the impact of each microservice's resource configuration (i.e., CPU and memory) on the QoS metrics (i.e. serving throughput and latency) of each SFC in a PTE. Then, considering an SP's Service Level Objectives (SLO), we proposed an algorithm to predict each microservice's resource capacities in a PE.

Agility in the microservice architecture heavily depends on fast management operations for containers, such as create, start, and stop. Since containers rely on administrative kernel services provided by the host operating system, the microservice architecture can be considered as a new workload for an operating system as it stresses those services differently from traditional workloads. We studied the scalability of container management operations for Docker, one of the most popular container management systems, from two aspects: core and container scalability, which indicate how much the number of processor cores and number of containers affect container management performance, respectively. We propose a hierarchical analysis approach to identify scalability bottlenecks where we analyze multiple layers of a software stack from the top to bottom layer. Our analysis reveals that core scalability has bottlenecks at a virtualization layer for storage and network devices, and that container scalability has bottlenecks at various components that inquire mount points. While those bottlenecks exist in a daemon process of Docker, the root causes are a couple of interfaces of the underlying kernel.

We consider the EdgeX Foundry platform as such an IIoT middleware, discuss how EdgeX can provide ready-to-use integration of IoT devices, and show how we connect it with a low-code XMDD coordination layer that interfaces with EdgeX microservices through a Native DSL mechanism. We consider this technology landscape from the point of view of a building automation system example that supports high reconfigurability and security. We show how to produce all the essential elements of a complex Web based application to control the considered building systems. We demonstrate various features of the application's data and process models, how DSLs play a role at various levels, and how to add security capabilities that go beyond the cross-layer concerns and mechanisms offered by EdgeX.

A multi-layer cloud architecture comprising of a high-capacity core center that is connected, through high speed links, to geographically distributed smart edges seem appropriate for highly distributed and heterogeneous IoT applications.

Serverless architectures enable decomposing software into independent components packaged and run using isolated containers or microVMs. This decomposition approach enables application hosting using very fine-grained cloud infrastructure enabling cost savings as deployments are billed granularly for resource use. Adoption of serverless platforms promise reduced hosting costs while achieving high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic elasticity. These benefits are offset by pricing obfuscation, as performance variance from CPU heterogeneity, multitenancy, and provisioning variation obscure the true cost of hosting applications with serverless platforms. Where determining hosting costs for traditional VM-based application deployments simply involves accounting for the number of VMs and their uptime, predicting hosting costs for serverless applications can be far more complex. To address these challenges, we introduce the Serverless Application Analytics Framework (SAAF), a tool that allows profiling FaaS workload performance, resource utilization, and infrastructure to enable accurate performance predictions. We apply Linux CPU time accounting principles and multiple regression to estimate FaaS function runtime. We predict runtime using a series of increasingly variant compute bound workloads that execute across heterogeneous CPUs, different memory settings, and to alternate FaaS platforms evaluating our approach for 77 different scenarios. We found that the mean absolute percentage error of our runtime predictions for these scenarios was just ~3.49% resulting in an average cost error of $6.46 for 1-million FaaS function workloads averaging $150.45 in price.",,978-1-7281-6609-4,10.1109/DASC-PICom-CBDCom-CyberSciTech49142.2020.00111,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251165,Serverless Computing;Function-as-a-Service;Performance Evaluation;Performance Modeling;Resource Contention;Multitenancy,Runtime;Linux;FAA;Pricing;Tools;Software;Stress,,22.0,,59.0,IEEE,11 Nov 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It is undeniable that migrating legacy telco applications to microservice-based architectures accelerates and facilitates the development of new network services while offering a high level of granularity. However, cloud native raises new operational challenges. In order to achieve an efficient management of network services, new solutions are required to monitor and track widely distributed cloud native network functions while considering their specificity. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework, 5GC-Observer, for the observability of cloud native 5G network services. To the best of our knowledge, no such a solution has been found to date. To achieve its goal, 5GC-Observer relies on the eBPF technology to monitor the network traffic circulating between the 5G core components and report telemetry data. Besides, we leverage a statistical method to detect Quality of Service degradation based on reported telemetry data. Such an approach highlights the richness of the data acquired by our solution and its capability to detect unexpected network-related anomalies. The latter are not detectable through standard observability solutions. Performance evaluation shows that our solution generates low overhead while giving insight into the 5G core system and its internal and external exchanges.",2374-9709,978-1-6654-7716-1,10.1109/NOMS56928.2023.10154433,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154433,5G;Cloud native;CNF;Kubernetes;Observability;Monitoring;Logging;Non-intrusive;eBPF,Degradation;5G mobile communication;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic;Quality of service;Telemetry;Stakeholders,,3.0,,47.0,IEEE,21 Jun 2023,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this paper, we analyze two distinct methods to tackle the monitoring problem in a system with reduced instrumentation. Our goal is to understand the feasibility of such approach with one specific driver: simplicity. We aim to determine the extent to which it is possible to characterize the state of two generic tandem processes, using as little information as possible. To answer this question, we resorted to a simulation approach. Using a queue system, we simulated two services, that we could manipulate with distinct operation sets for each module. We used the total response time seen upstream of the system. Having this setup and metric, we applied two distinct methods to analyze the results. First, we used supervised machine learning algorithms to identify where the bottleneck is happening. Secondly, we used an exponential decomposition to identify the occupation in the two components in a more black-box fashion. Results show that both methodologies have their advantages and limitations. The separation of the signal more accurately identifies occupation in low occupied resources, but when a service is totally dominating the overall time, it lacks precision. The machine learning has a more stable error, but needs the training set. This study suggest that a black-box occupation approach with both techniques is possible and very useful.",,978-1-5386-7659-2,10.1109/NCA.2018.8548336,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8548336,Black-box monitoring;Observability;Simulation;Analytics,Monitoring;Instruments;Tools;Mathematical model;Machine learning;Observability;Measurement,,1.0,,22.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It leverages modern principles of virtualized network functions, microservices-based service chaining, and cloud-native software stacks. Moreover, it provides built-in security and mechanisms for slicing. Despite all these capabilities, there remain many gaps and opportunities for additional capabilities to support end-to-end secure operations for applications across many domains. Although 5G supports mechanisms for network slicing and tunneling, new algorithms and mechanisms that can adapt network slice configurations dynamically to accommodate urgent and mission-critical traffic are needed. Such slices must be secure, interference-aware, and free of side channel attacks.
