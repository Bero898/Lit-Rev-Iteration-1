After the first year, it was used as a pathfinder for the creation of SensorWebs. A SensorWeb is the integration of a variety of space, airborne and ground sensors into a loosely coupled collaborative sensor system that automatically provides useful data products. Typically, a SensorWeb is comprised of heterogeneous sensors tied together with an open messaging architecture and web services. SensorWebs provide easier access to sensor data, automated data product production and rapid data product delivery. Disasters are the perfect arena to test SensorWeb functionality since emergency workers and managers need easy and rapid access to satellite, airborne and in-situ sensor data as decision support tools. The Namibia Early Flood Warning SensorWeb pilot project was established to experiment with various aspects of sensor interoperability and SensorWeb functionality. The SensorWeb system features EO-1 data along with other data sets from such satellites as Radarsat, Terra and Aqua. Finally, the SensorWeb team began to examine how to measure economic impact of SensorWeb technology infusion. This paper describes the architecture and software components that were developed along with performance improvements that were experienced. Also, problems and challenges that were encountered are described along with a vision for future enhancements to mitigate some of the problems.",2151-1535,,10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2255861,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6509993,Earth Observing One (EO-1);Flood Early Warning;sensor systems and applications;SensorWeb,Floods;Sensors;Satellites;Earth;Computer architecture;Service-oriented architecture,,28.0,,10.0,IEEE,29 Apr 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
Long Live the Image: On Enabling Resilient Production Database Containers for Microservice Applications,Z. Li; N. Saldías-Vallejos; D. Seco; M. A. Rodríguez; R. Ranjan,"School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen’s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K.; Department of Computer Science, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile; Department of Computer Science and Information Technologies, Universidade de A Coruña, A Coruña, Spain; Department of Computer Science, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile; School of Computing, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.",IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,18 Sep 2024,2024,50,9,2363,2378,"Microservices architecture advocates decentralized data ownership for building software systems. Particularly, in the Database per Service pattern, each microservice is supposed to maintain its own database and to handle the data related to its functionality. When implementing microservices in practice, however, there seems to be a paradox: The de facto technology (i.e., containerization) for microservice implementation is claimed to be unsuitable for the microservice component (i.e., database) in production environments, mainly due to the data persistence issues (e.g., dangling volumes) and security concerns. As a result, the existing discussions generally suggest replacing database containers with cloud database services, while leaving the on-premises microservice implementation out of consideration. After identifying three statelessness-dominant application scenarios, we proposed container-native data persistence as a conditional solution to enable resilient database containers in production. In essence, this data persistence solution distinguishes stateless data access (i.e., reading) from stateful data processing (i.e., creating, updating, and deleting), and thus it aims at the development of stateless microservices for suitable applications. In addition to developing our proposal, this research is particularly focused on its validation, via prototyping the solution and evaluating its performance, and via applying this solution to two real-world microservice applications. From the industrial perspective, the validation results have proved the feasibility, usability, and efficiency of fully containerized microservices for production in applicable situations. From the academic perspective, this research has shed light on the operation-side micro-optimization of individual microservices, which fundamentally expands the scope of “software micro-optimization” and reveals new research opportunities.",1939-3520,,10.1109/TSE.2024.3436623,ANID Millennium Science Initiative Program(grant numbers:Code ICN17_002); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620003,Container;data persistence;read-only database;stateless microservice;microservices architecture,Databases;Containers;Microservice architectures;Production;Usability;Runtime;Prototypes,,,,67.0,IEEE,1 Aug 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Therefore, the adaptations of the new bioprocess industry require a lot of flexibility to react quickly and constantly to market changes and to be able to offer more specialized, customized products with high operational efficiency. This paper presents a flexible, scalable, and robust framework based on software components, container technology, microservice concepts, and the publish/subscribe paradigm. This framework allows new components to be added or removed online, without the need for system reconfiguration, while maintaining temporal and functional constraints in industrial automation systems. The main objective of the framework proposed is the use of components based on microservices, allowing easy implementation, scalability, and fast maintenance, without losing or degrading the robustness from previous developments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework was verified in two case studies (1) a soursop soda making process is presented, with a fuzzy controller implemented to keep the pasteurizer output flow constant (UHT) and (2) an automatic storage tank selection and filling process with actuated valves to direct the fluid to the corresponding tank at the time to start the process. The results showed that the platform provided a high-fidelity design, analysis, and testing environment for the flow of cyber information and its effect on the physical operation in a beverage processing plant with high demand for flexibility, scalability, and robustness of its processes, as they were experimentally verified in a real production process.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3072040,"Research Cooperation between the Universidad de Colima (Mexico), the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (Colombia), and the Juice Production Plant Punta Delicia, Colima, Mexico; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399423,Industry 40;distributed industrial automation systems;interoperability;middleware;industrial cyber-physical systems,Computer architecture;Scalability;Containers;Industries;Real-time systems;Production;Process control,,11.0,,30.0,CCBY,9 Apr 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
